This directory contains the hppen directory:
	hpdaemon program BUT


You must select whether the plotter is RS232 or HP-IB
also you must select CUTTER or NOCUTTER
and PLOTTER or PLOTTER2

PLOTTER is for a HP9872 class plotter with CUTTER
PLOTTER2 is for a HP7550 class plotter without a ccutter (NOCUTTER).

Before doing the make here, you must install the strings package.
FIRST: check to see if you have the fillowing files:

    /usr/include/strings.h
    libstrings.a (should be in /usr/lib but maybe /lib)

If strings.h does not exist, copy the strings/strings.h
include file to /usr/include/strings.h
Find this file as follows.

   cd to the strings/strings directory (from specpr/hppen, it is
usually ../../strings/strings)

If the libstrings.a file does not exist, you must make it as
follows. (cd to the strings/strings directory).

Read the Makefile and customize it if necessary for you system
type.

Run make

On HPUX the make makes all the .o files then starts the .s files,
but the .s stuff is only for VAXes so it failes.  Forget about them
(.s files) and make the library yourself:

   ar -rvl strings.a *.o 
   ll strings.a 
   cp strings.a /usr/lib/libstrings.a 

The strings package is installed.

make and install the hpdaemon programs:

   makeall
   make install 
   more makefile 
   make install2 
   ll /usr/lib/hpdaemon* 

Do the mknod for your plotter(s) (see your system admin manual.
You need:
          /dev/plotter
          /dev/plotter2    (if you have a second plotter)


Install the spooler package:  Here is a complete sequence for SYS V (HP_UX):

as root do:
   cp SPOOLERS/SYSV.speclab/model/hp7550a.plottr /usr/spool/lp/model 
   cp SPOOLERS/SYSV.speclab/model/hp9872s.plottr /usr/spool/lp/model 
   chown lp /usr/spool/lp/model/*.plottr 
   chgrp bin /usr/spool/lp/model/*.plottr 
   cd SPOOLERS/SYSV.speclab 
   /usr/lib/lpshut 
   ./mkplotters 
   /usr/lib/lpsched 
   /usr/lib/accept hpplotter1 
   /usr/lib/accept hpplotter2 
   plotq 

The SYS V spooler setup is now complete

Now some additional directories need to be made:

   cd /usr/spool/ 
   mkdir gplot 
   chmod 777 gplot 
   mkdir /usr/log 
   cat /dev/null > /usr/log/hpdaemon 
   chmod 666 /usr/log/hpdaemon 
   ll /usr/log/hpdaemon 

You are done!
