F8:  Channel-Record Transpose                             Alias: tran[spose]
This routine transposes the array of channel (column) versus
spectrum (rows) to spectrum versus channel.  For example, if you
had 10 spectra of 5 channels each where each spectrum was taken
at 1 hour intervals, this routine transposes the matrix so that
there are 5 output &quot;spectra&quot; of 10 channels each where each
&quot;spectrum&quot; is intensity at 10 different times.

Example: given 4 spectra of 3 channels each:

              Spectrum |    Channel number
              Number   |  1       2       3
                       |---------------------
                   1   | 1.23   1.34    1.45
                   2   | 2.23   2.34    2.45
                   3   | 3.23   3.34    3.45
                   4   | 4.23   4.34    4.45

would be transposed to:

             Spectrum |    Channel number
              Number   |  1       2       3       4
                       |-----------------------------
                   1   | 1.23   2.23    3.23    4.23
                   2   | 1.34   2.34    3.34    4.34
                   3   | 1.45   2.45    3.45    4.45
</pre>

<p>WARNING: When you first enter the transpose routine, it
prints the wavelength set in use. The wavelength set
controls the number of channels (and thus the potential
number of output spectra), so it must be set to the right
value. The first input request is an option to delete
channels. If you delete input channels, the output spectrum
will have that channel deleted. You delete channels by
typing &quot;d&quot; and the channels to be deleted (see
plot routines for a more complete description of the delete
points routine), and a &quot;c&quot; to continue to the next
step. For example, say you had 20 spectra of 100 channels
each, taken as a function of time and you wanted to only
have a data set that was the intensity of channel 33. You
would delete all but channel 33:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>d 1t32 34t100 c</p></td>
</table>

<p>(you may include spaces anywhere except within a
number). Next, you will be requested to enter each
(non-deleted) channel. Input spectra are entered one per
line (file letter ID and record number). When all are typed
in, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>b</p></td>
</table>

<p>to begin transpose. The routine will next ask for the
beginning output location (type in file letter ID and record
number) and then a common title for all the output spectra.
The transpose will then begin and the output spectra will be
output sequentially beginning at the beginning point in the
file that you selected. The number of output spectra is
equal to the number of channels in use minus the deleted
channels.</p>
