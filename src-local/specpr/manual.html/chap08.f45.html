F45:  Automatic Band Analysis                           Alias = aba
This routine uses the segmented upper hull (see f44) to isolate
absorption features in a spectrum and then for each feature the
following are derived:

          Band Center
          Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)
          Band Depth
          Error in band depth (assuming that error bars were included with the
                   input spectrum)
          Full Width at Quarter Maximum (FWQM)
          Band Asymmetry
          Continuum reflectance level
          Segmented Upper Hull iteration number
</pre>

<p>The output is a data set using 9 channels to describe
each feature (the 8 items above and one additional that is
currently unused). Thus if the input spectrum contained 26
features, then the output data set would have 234 channels.
This routine was used to generate the features in the USGS
Digital Spectral Library. For a description of the continuum
algorithm, see Clark, R.N., T.V.V. King, and N.S. Gorelick,
Automatic Continuum Analysis of Reflectance Spectra:
Proceedings of the Third Airborne Imaging Spectrometer Data
Analysis Workshop, JPL Publication 87-30, 138-142, 1987.
Once the continuum is removed, the band center is found by
finding the lowest channel in a feature and fitting a
parabola to the lowest channel and the channel in each side
of the lowest one. The FWHM, and FWQM are found by linear
interpolation. The error bar is found based on the error
bars on the data. The asymmetry is found by ratioing the
distance from the band center to each FWHM point. See also
section 9.8, Interactive Band Analysis (it uses the same
algorithms).</p>
