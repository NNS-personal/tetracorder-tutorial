F12:  Cubic Spline Interpolation                             Alias: cspl[in]
F12:  Derivative
This routine fits a cubic spline to an input data set, and then computes
a new data set based on a new wavelength set specified by the user.
This allows you to smoothly interpolate one data set to another (not
this is not a convolution).  Errors, if specified, are also
interpolated.  The input data set and its associated wavelengths are
used to derive a cubic spline describing the curve.  The curve may then
be recomputed at other wavelengths, or because the curve is described by
a set of polynomials, the derivative of the curve may be computed.
The input wavelength set can be the same as the
output wavelength set, then with selected parts of the spectrum
deleted, a continuum can be computed.  For example, in this mode,
you would simply delete all the channels comprising a particular
absorption band.  The computed spectrum is then the input spectrum
without the absorption band.  See

for examples of continua and a discussion of the theoretical
aspects of continua.
The program requires that the input data set and its
error bars, if any, be specified when called from Math Operations.
For example;

              v23f14e
or
              v23csplin e
</pre>

<p>Upon entering the routine, the title to the data to be
splined is displayed and you are asked select normal spline
or derivative mode:</p>
<pre>              &lt;return&gt; for cubic spline mode,
              d        for derivative mode,
              e  or  x to exit.
</pre>

<p>Next, you will be asked to input two wavelength data
sets, the first for the input data set, the second for the
output interpolation. The wavelength sets should be entered
with capital letter file IDs. Example:</p>
<pre>              V24 U46
or
              V15 V15
</pre>

<p>where the first interpolates to a new wavelength set,
and the second example interpolates to the same wavelength
set, presumably with the intent of deleting some channels to
use the result as a continuum. Finally, you are asked if you
want to delete points. If you do, just type in the channels
to be deleted, separated by spaces, or ranges separated by a
&quot;t&quot;, and then terminated by a &quot;c&quot;. For
example:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>1 2 59t63 120 c</p></td>
</table>

<p>deletes channels 1, 2, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, and 120. You
can use more than one line, and the deletion routine is not
finished until it gets the &quot;c&quot;. WARNING: Cubic
splining can be tricky. For example, glitches in data could
lead to erroneous results, so you should delete those
channels. The cubic spline routine used requires each
wavelength set to be sorted in increasing order, and the
interpolated wavelength to be within the bounds of the other
wavelength set. F12 handles this, minimizing errors that
could occur. However, it seems common to have problems. If
you get one of the following &quot;F12 errors,&quot; note
the number and other pertinent information (e.g. data sets
in use) and submit a bug report if you can&rsquo;t figure
out a cause. NOTE, HOWEVER that a usual cause is bad input,
most likely due to two wavelengths that have the same value
(causing an infinite slope), and an extremely high data
value (causing a near infinite slope), or some channel or
wavelength not what you think it is (like not in the proper
overlap range). Check your data carefully before reporting
bugs. If you have problems, you should carefully check all
your data by both plotting it and examining the values with
the data editor, f14. For example, if you find deleted
channels in the input wavelength data set, you should
include those channels in the list of channels to be deleted
in the spline routine (f12).</p>

<p>Error codes from the cubic spline routine:</p>

<p>131: Wavelength files are not ordered. (Since the routine

</table>

<p>The spline function is very useful for interpolating
data to new wavelength values and also for generating
continua. When interpolating to a new wavelength set, the
resolution of the spectra should be equal (use the smoothing
function of F17 to degrade a high resolution spectrum to
that of the low resolution spectrum). Spurious data points
should be deleted. For generating a continuum to a spectrum,
specify the same wavelength file for the input and output
spectra, then delete data points which are not on the
&quot;continuum.&quot; This can be tricky depending on the
data and what you are trying to do so talk to people who
have used the routine first (e.g. Roger Clark or Bob
Singer).</p>

<p align=center>How the Cubic Spline Interpolating Function
Works</p>

<p>The cubic spline interpolating function may be
visualized as follows. Bend a flexible strip (like a plastic
ruler) so that it passes through each of the data points in
the spectrum to be interpolated</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="81%">
<p>[f(x1), f(x2), . . . f(xn)].</p></td>
</table>

<p>The physics of the bent strip shows that the equation of
the strip can be represented as a series of cubic
polynomials with appropriate boundary conditions. A
different cubic polynomial is calculated for each interval
in the spectrum</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="81%">
<p>[i.e. S1(x) on the interval (x1, x2),</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>S2(x) on (x2, x3) . . . S{n-1}(x) on (x{n-1},
xn)</p></td>
</table>

<p>where Sn represents a cubic polynomial</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="81%">
<p>Anx3 + Bnx2 + Cnx + Dn = Sn(x)].</p></td>
</table>

<p>The boundary conditions are that the spline must go
through each function value</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="81%">
<p>[S1 (x1) = f(x1), S1 (x2) = f(x2) = S2(x2) =
etc.],</p></td>
</table>

<p>and the first and second derivatives of the cubic
polynomials are continuous</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="81%">
<p>[S{m-1}&rsquo;(xm) = Sm&rsquo;(xm), S{m-1}&quot;(xm) =
Sm&quot;(xm)</p></td>
</table>

<p>for m on the interval 2 to (n-1) (inclusive)]. Finally,
the curvature is forced to zero at the endpoints</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="81%">
<p>[S1&quot;(x1) = 0, S{n-1}&quot;(xn) = 0].</p></td>
</table>

<p>The spline used here is NOT a smoothing function.
Therefore, data with large noise spikes present should be
pre-smoothed before fitting with the interpolating spline
(or the data points with anomalous values should be
deleted). For a more complete discussion see Carnahan and J.
O. Wilkes, &quot;Digital Computing and Numerical
Methods,&quot; John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, New York. p
