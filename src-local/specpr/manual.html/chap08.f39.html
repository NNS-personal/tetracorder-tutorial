F39:  Random Number Noise Generator                     Alias = noise
This routine uses the system random number generator to generate
noise with a normal distribution and a standard deviation of 1.0.
The user can then multiply the resulting numbers by a constant to
generate noise with a different standard deviation, and the noise may
be added to a spectrum.
The routine generates a random number for each channel in use.  The
user then gives a scale factor to scale the noise to the desired
interval.  For example if you wanted noise of 3% (standard deviation
of 0.03), you would scale the noise by 0.03.
