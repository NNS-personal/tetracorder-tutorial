F17:  High To Low Resolution Convolution                    Alias: conv[olv]
Routine f17 convolves a high resolution data set to a low resolution
data set.  It has 2 modes:  1) use Gaussian profiles whose widths and
centers are specified by the user, or 2) use user-specified filter
profiles.  The routine outputs two data sets:  (1) the resultant
wavelength values (center values) and (2) the convolved spectrum.  The
output of the center values is optional.  A typical use would be to
use mode 1 (Gaussian profiles) for convolving one spectrometer to
another, and mode 2 for convolving a spectrum to a
specific filter response, such as a LANDSAT TM system.
To run the function, go to the math routines and enter the
file ID and number for the input spectrum and f17.  Example:

             v23f17
or
              v23conv

The routine starts with a query for the use of the
default wavelength assignment, which is displayed at the top of
the screen.  To change the default assignment, enter
the wavelength data set file ID (upper case) and the record number.
If you don&rsquo;t want to change the wavelength set, just type return.
Next you will be asked whether you want to normalize the data.  This
is a convolution normalization.  Normally you want to do this.  If
you normalize,the resulting spectrum is divided by a convolved
spectrum whose input data values are all one.  If you don&rsquo;t
normalize, the convolution output will vary as a function of the
area under the curve of each response function.  Unnormalized
convolutions can be used for tracking voltages from a sensor.  If
you simply want to compare the spectral response, calibrated to, say,
radiance or reflectance, and your input data are calibrated in
those units, you want to normalize the convolution.
Next you are asked if you want to use the Gaussian mode or the
filter bandpass mode.  Type:

              g           Gaussian mode.
              &lt;return&gt;    bandpass filter mode.
</pre>

<p>Gaussian Profile Convolution You are first asked for a
data set describing the center values of the Gaussians for
the output data set (these are the wavelengths you are
convolving to). Enter the file ID and record number of the
data set. Next you are prompted to enter the Gaussian
bandwidths. These are the Gaussian Full Width at Half Maxima
(FWHM) for each Gaussian center value entered in the
previous step. Enter the file ID and the record number of
this data set. The Gaussian bandwidth data set and the
Gaussian center values must have the same number of
channels. Next your are asked to input the bandwidths of the
input data set. The spectral resolution of the input data
set must be known to properly convolve to the output data
set. Enter the file ID and record number of the input
spectrum resolution. This data set must have the same number
of channels as the input wavelength data set in use. The
convolution routine computes the convolution and then asks
if you want to output the center wavelengths. See below.</p>

<p>Bandpass Filter Convolution If you selected the bandpass
filter convolution mode, the routine prompts you for the
first filter profile and asks how many filters will be
convolved. Each filter profile produces one output channel.
The filter profile must be sampled at the wavelengths of the
input data set (if it is not, you could reinterpolate them
using a routine like the cubic spline, f12). For example,
say you were convolving a laboratory spectrum of kaolinite
to LANDSAT TM filters (7 bands). Say the filter response
function sampled at the wavelengths of the laboratory
spectrum was at w46 (the other 6 filters must be
sequentially located in the same data file). You would then
type:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>w46 7</p></td>
</table>

<p>The input filter response functions are read in and the
output spectrum is calculated. Next the user is asked if the
output of center wavelengths is desired.</p>

<p>Center Wavelengths After the convolution is complete
(either Gaussian or bandpass mode) you are queried on
whether or not to output the center value wavelengths. If
you wish to write the center values, type in the file id and
record number of the file where you wish to write the center
values, or type return to ignore writing the center values.
Next enter the title for the center values when prompted.
Because this is an output data set (like any other), use a
lower case file id(not upper case).</p>

<p>Note that f17 cannot include errors in its calculations.
However, you can do error propagation by simply convolving
the error data set in the same manner as the regular data
set.</p>

<p>The equation used to calculate the spline is</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="37%"></td>
<td width="62%">
<p>Rj = &int;xxl S Bj dx, (eqn 8.f17.1)</p></td>
</table>

<p>where Rj is a data point in the resultant spectrum, xo
is the first value of the input spectrum, xl is the last
value of the input spectrum, S is the input spectrum, and Bj
is the spectral bandpasses. The center values are calculated
by the following:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="37%"></td>
<td width="62%">
<p>Cj = &int;xxl x S Bj dx, (eqn 8.f17.2)</p></td>
</table>

<p>where Cj is the center value for that particular
spectral bandpass, xl, S, Bj and xo are the same as in
equation 8.f17.2, and x is the wavelength. The integrals are
approximated by using numerical integration by summing the
rectangular segments. Each rectangle is computed by using
the channel separation of the input spectrum:</p>
<pre>               n
          Rj = &Sigma;  Si Bj,i &delta;xi,                        (eqn 8.f17.3)
              i=1
</pre>

<p>where n is the number of channels and &delta;xi is the
spectral bandpass of channel i</p>
<pre>                &#9581;  x2 - x1,      i = 1
                &#9474;
          &delta;xi = &#9509;  xi+1 - xi-1,  1 &lt; i &lt; n                      (eqn 8.f17.4)
                &#9474;
                &#9584;  xn-1 - xn,    i = n
</pre>

<p>Similarly, the center values (wavelength) of each
convolved channel are computed from the equation</p>
<pre>               n
               &Sigma; xi Si Bj,i &delta;xi    (eqn 8.f17.3)
              i=1
          Cj = &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
                        Rj
</pre>

<p>During the calculations, divide operations are checked
for a zero denominator. If this happens, an error message is
printed for the user, and the denominator is reset to
1.0&times;10-36 instead of crashing the program. If no file
has been input to the program at the start, an error message
will be printed, and the routine exits. Note that if the
number of bandpass files times five is greater than the
number of channels, a warning message will be printed
explaining that, with data arranged in such a manner, the
resulting accuracy of the data is questionable. This is due
to using the summations (equations 3 and 5) and the equation
4 to approximate the integrals. The message is only a
warning--you must determine if the bandpasses are complex
enough that accuracy may actually be in error due to a small
sample. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION: if the filter bandpass or
the Gaussian profile is close to the input spectral
resolution, you may want to interpolate the input spectra to
finer channel spacing. Because the numerical integration
rectangles are controlled by the channel spacing,
interpolating to finer spacing will increase the accuracy of
the numerical integration. You must interpolate both the
input spectra and the resolution &quot;spectrum&quot; to the
finer wavelength set. Remember, for example, if you had
0.001 &mu;m spacing and 0.001 &mu;m resolution, and you
interpolated to 0.0001 &mu;m spacing, the resolution is
still only 0.001 &mu;m, thus the spectrum is oversampled.
This oversampling is only useful in terms of making the
numerical integration more accurate. If your convolved
spectra show a &quot;staircase&quot; effect, it is an
indication of the limitation of the numerical integration
and you should resample the input data to finer spacing.</p>
