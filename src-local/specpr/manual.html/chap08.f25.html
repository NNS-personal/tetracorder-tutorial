F25:  Two Component Areal Mix Least Squares             Alias = twoc[omlsq]
This special function computes the best areal mixture of two &quot;known&quot;
spectra as compared to an observed spectrum.  The user provides
his or her own guess as to what the end-member spectra are and the
routine computes the least squares fit of the two.
WARNING:
This routine was a developmental version at the University of Hawaii
and has never been certified as to its method.  It currently works
for spectra without error bars and with channels less than or equal to
256.  If you do use this routine, you must verify for yourself the
accuracy of the method.  A full manual entry is waiting on proper
certification of this routine.
