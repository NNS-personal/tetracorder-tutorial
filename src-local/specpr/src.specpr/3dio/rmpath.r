#   TITLE:             REMOVE PATH ROUTINE                         *
#   PROGRAMMER:        Barry J. Middlebrook                        *
#------------------------------------------------------------------*
#   DESCRIPTION:                                                   *
#               This algorithm is designed to remove the path name *
#               from the full file designation.  It accomplishes   *
#               this by finding the last slash and the first space *
#               in the character buffer holding the file designa-  *
#               tion.  The file name is extracted by setting the   *
#               file name variable equal to the character string   *
#               bounded by last slash position plus 1 and first    *
#               space position minus 1 in the input character buf- *
#               fer.  As an example, consider the file designation *
#                                                                  *
#               u/src/filename                                     *
#               1234567      14                                    *
#                                                                  *
#               The routine finds the last slash index value which *
#               is equal to 6 and the first space index value      *
#               which is equal to 15.  It would then conclude that *
#               the file name is positioned in the input character *
#               buffer from the index 7 to 14.  Therefore,         *
#               <file name> = <character buffer (7:14)>            *
#                                                                  *
#               NOTE:  Path name spaces are allowed, however, the  *
#                      file name will be incorrect if it has       *
#                      any spaces within the name or more than one *
#                      preceding it.                               *
#                                                                  *
