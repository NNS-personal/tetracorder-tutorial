     NAME
	  sptoascii - convert specpr formatted data to an ascii file

     SYNOPSIS
	  sptoascii  [specpr.filename]  >  [ascii.filename]

     DESCRIPTION
	  This program takes specpr data previously converted by
	  spectrans and outputs it into a textfile where changes
	  can easily be made to the data or text added.
	  Translation takes approximately 15-20 seconds per
	  record, so translating very large files will not break
	  any speed records.


     FILES
	  Source files: /usr/src/cmd/specpr/datatran
	  Executable :  /usr/bin
