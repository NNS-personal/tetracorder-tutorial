     NAME
	  asciitosp - convert  ascii data to specpr format

     SYNOPSIS
	  asciitosp  [specpr.filename] < [ ascii.filename]

     DESCRIPTION
	  This program takes ascii files translated from specpr
	  format by sptoascii(see manual) and translates them
	  back to specpr format again. Modifications or insertions
	  made to the ascii file are converted to specpr format.
	  Be sure that the specpr file is empty and ready to receive
	  data by using:   cat /dev/null >! [specpr.filename]
     
     EXAMPLE
	  To change information in headers or data simply make the
	  approriate changes, being sure not to change the position
	  of the headers.
	  To add a text file, follow this example:

		ititl: test of text
		text: 

			Main body of appended text

		ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

	  The 20 Z's are needed to mark the end of the text.
	  When modifying an existing textfile, be sure to leave
	  the Z's in place.
