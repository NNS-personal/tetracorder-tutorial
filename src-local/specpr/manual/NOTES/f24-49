8.6.43. F43:  FFT and Inverse FFT
              Manual entry to be written
              Notes: the FFT is not folded (zero frequency is at
              beginning and end of output data set.  Also: the frequencies
              for the second half of the FFT are not correct (they are
              still increasing; they should decrease from the mid-point).
