WAVELENGTHS

     Wavelengths are any data set in a specpr data file.  For example
in v23 could be a 1-dimensional array of reflectance values, 256
channels in length, and in v24 is a 256-channel array of wavelength
values.  From the display routines, you could plot reflectance on the
vertical axis and wavelength on the horizontal axis with the command
"v23V24".  Alternatively, you could plot wavelength on the vertical
axis versus reflectance on the horizontal axis with the command
"v24V23".  In all cases, the "wavelengths" are obtained by using a
capital letter for the data file and a record number.

     The wavelength set can also be changed when in the CRT plot routines.
Just type in the capital leter ID and the record number of any data set.
