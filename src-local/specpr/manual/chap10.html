<p align=center>DATA DISPLAY, TRANSFER, AND OVERLAY</p>

<p>10.1 Introduction The data display, transfer, and
overlay routines are used to display data on the graphics
terminal (or X-window device), transfer data records from
one file to another (or to another place in the same file),
and overlay data on X-windows or graphics terminals. To
transfer means to copy; specpr does not (nor is it intended
to be able to) remove the original. Historically, the
transfer routines were written to &quot;transfer&quot; a
copy of the data on a magnetic tape to a disk file. Because
of this need, there are restrictions when transferring data
records from disk to tape or tape to disk so that the
records will properly coincide and the proper histories will
be maintained.</p>

<p>10.2 Data Display A spectrum can be displayed on the CRT
using the CRT plot routines (section 9) by typing in the
file ID (v, w, d, u, or y), the record number, and any
options. For example,</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v23</p></td>
</table>

<p>displays the data in file v, record 23 with the current
wavelength set and graphics line types. Options can be
included to change the wavelength set in use, change the
number of channels, include error bars and do other
things.</p>
<pre>     Options:

             e   to include error bars,
              a   to auto scale within the current plotting window,
              b   to auto scale and make a printer plot.
              l#  to change the graphics line type (see Chapter 9),
              i   to display header information first, not the graphics,
              &amp;   use the wavelength pointer with the data to get
                      the wavelength set.
              +n  sequentially plot the next &quot;n&quot; records, where n is
                      an integer.

             V, W, D, U, or Y, followed by the record number sets the
                  wavelength set in use to the new value.
              C#  sets the wavelengths equal to channel number with
                      the number of channels = &quot;#&quot;.
              h   sets the plot type to channel mode.
</pre>

<p>For example, if v23 contains a reflectance spectrum of
the mineral Alunite, and v20 contains the wavelengths to the
spectrum, you could type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v23V20</p></td>
</table>

<p>to plot reflectance on the vertical axis versus
wavelength. Alternatively, if you typed:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v20V23</p></td>
</table>

<p>the plot would have wavelength on the vertical axis and
reflectance on the horizontal axis. If many records in
sequence are to be plotted, then directly after the record
number type &quot;+&quot; and the number of records to be
plotted. Thus, to plot spectra from device v, records 10 to
32, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v10+22</p></td>
</table>

<p>where the +22 means the next 22 records after the
requested record should also be processed. Note that the +
specification will yield strange results with option e
(include errors) since the record increment is always 1.
Thus, after plotting data with errors (e.g. record v10 =
data and record v11 = errors), the record increment will be
one, and the errors will be plotted as data with the next
record plotted as the errors to the errors! To plot many
spectra in sequence which all have error records, they must
be typed in sequentially such as v10e v12e v14e v16e v18e
v20e v22e. Note no spaces are required, but they can be
inserted if desired. No commas are necessary (this is
different from Math Operations). If your spectra take up
more than one record, you must count by records, not
spectra. Because the increment is by records, multiple
records to one spectrum increments the counter by the number
of records not by the number of spectra. For example, if you
have 512 channel spectra, and you want to overlay 3 spectra
(each spectrum takes 2 records in the data file) you would
use the current spectrum record number plus 5 records. If
the first spectrum was at v20, then the next two are at v22
and v24, so type &quot;v20+5&quot; (which is equivalent to
&quot;v20 v22 v24&quot;).</p>

<p>10.3 File Transfer Files can be transferred by
specifying the file ID, record number, the transfer
specification</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>t</p></td>
</table>

<p>and the file ID and record number where the transfer is
to go. Note that &quot;transfer&quot; means to copy. Many
records may be transferred sequentially by using the plus
specification. For example,</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v10td23</p></td>
</table>

<p>transfers (makes a copy of) file v record 10 to file d
record 23. Also,</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v10+99td23</p></td>
</table>

<p>transfers file v record 10 plus the next 99 records to
file d record 23 plus the next 99 records. Thus, file v
record 109 will be the last record transferred and will go
to file d record 99 + 23 = 122.</p>

<p>10.3.1 File Transfer with Plot or Information Change
Records that are going to be transferred can be plotted (and
thus can have points deleted, deglitched, or information
changed, see section 9) before the transfer is actually
carried out by the option</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>c</p></td>
</table>

<p>which stands for &quot;crt plot routines.&quot; Thus, to
transfer v10 plus the next 5 records to d23 and display them
before transferring, type:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v10 + 5 ct d23</p></td>
</table>

<p>(the spaces are not necessary, but are included for
clarity). The first file ID and record number represent a
request to read the data. The &quot;t&quot; option means to
set up a transfer (copy). The &quot;c&quot; option means to
also enter the crt plot routines for anything you may wish
to do. The transfer is always the last step processed
regardless of the order of the options. However, the
destination of the transfer must come after all other
options. If information only needs to be changed, the CRT
plot can be skipped and the information change routine
called directly by a</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>cit</p></td>
</table>

<p>specification as in</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v10 + 5 cit d23.</p></td>
</table>

<p>The c is required since the information change routine
is part of the CRT plot routines. The &quot;i&quot; then
signals the CRT plot routines that the information change
routine only is requested. Note, when transferring data to a
protected (positive or zero protection value) file, the
record number to transfer to must be 1 plus the protection
value. For example, if you transfer to v1 but 100 records
are protected, the program will say there is a protection
violation. However, you do not need to specify the
destination record number if the file is protected with
write at the end of the file (protection value is positive).
For example, to transfer from w36 to file v whose protection
is 100,</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>w36tv</p></td>
</table>

<p>and</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>w36tv101</p></td>
</table>

<p>are equivalent.</p>

<p>10.3.2 Starpack Transfers Starpack transfers involve 3
regular data records. Thus, transferring starpack 1 (s1) to
v10 (s1tv10) will result in the starpack being put into v10,
v11, and v12. When the starpack is transferred back, the
program automatically collects the 3 records for starpack
s1. Thus, to transfer 6 starpacks (1 - 6) to file v starting
at record 29, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>s1 + 5t v29.</p></td>
</table>

<p>The starpack will be put in records 29 through 46. To
transfer these starpacks back, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v29 + 5 t s1.</p></td>
</table>

<p>When the program sees that starpacks are being
transferred, it knows the +5 means 5 starpacks at 3 regular
records per starpack.</p>

<p>10.4 Overlaying Data Sets Overlaying spectra on the CRT
is an excellent way to compare data for reproducibility. The
overlay is an option used in file display (see section
10.2). To overlay spectra, type the file ID, record number,
and the option letter o. The o must be included in every
spectrum to be overlaid. Errors can be included, and the
overlay can be plotted as a function of channel, wavelength,
or inverse wavelength (the program assumes the wavelength
values are in microns and converts the values to
wavenumber). Also, you can change the graphics line type
with each spectrum so that all data sets are
distinguishable. For example, to overlay v23, v30 and w56 on
the same plot, each with a different line type, you could
type:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v23ol3 v30ol5 w56ol7</p></td>
</table>

<p>where the line types 3, 5, and 7 are used (see Chapter 9
for descriptions of the line types). To overlay data sets
with different wavelength sets, include the wavelength set
as an option. For example if y25 has wavelength set y20 and
d104 has wavelength set d3, you could type:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>y25Y20ol3 d104D3ol7</p></td>
</table>

<p>The plot type (wavelength, inverse wavelength, or
channel) can be set as an option on the first file to be
overlaid. However, when in wavelength mode, you should not
be in the auto-scale mode. The minimum and maximum
wavelengths can be different for different data sets; thus
the CRT plot routine will scale the data differently if the
wavelengths are auto-scaled. To avoid this problem, simply
set the minimum and maximum wavelengths to accept the range
of all of your data sets. Many spectra in sequence can be
plotted and overlaid by using the plus specification as in
section 10.2. The program tells you when the last file in a
sequence is overlaid on the CRT. The plus specification will
give strange results when including errors as noted in
section 10.2. Another example of overlaying many spectra
is:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>v10V8l6o v11el3o d23D20 + 5o y51oY30.</p></td>
</table>

<p>Note that the letter o is required on the last file to
be overlaid. Note that the &quot;o&quot; is not always in
the same place: it doesn&rsquo;t matter what order the
options are in. The &quot;e&quot; means include error bars.
If an &quot;o&quot; option is not included with each
spectrum, the screen will be erased, and that particular
spectrum will be displayed as in section 10.2.</p>

<p>Note that the wavelength set stays the same until it is
changed again.</p>

<p>10.5 Multiple Commands in Data Display Transfer and
Overlay One entire line (80 characters) can be input for
execution. These commands can be mixed freely between data
displays, file transfers, or data overlays. Spaces may be
included anywhere on the line, but none are necessary. An
example of multiple commands is:</p>
<pre>        v1+3ctd1 w34+10W4 v23+14oV6 v38eo v102+243tv236 v346+10citd480.

First there is a display and transfer of 4 spectra, then 11 spectra
are displayed, then 16 spectra overlaid (the last with error
bars), next 244 records are transferred, then 11 are transferred
with information change first.
In any of these routines, typing an

             e

will exit to the next command,
(including the next one in sequence)
and typing

             x

will exit back to Data Display, Transfer and Overlay
(except in the information change, see section 9) without
execution of the remaining commands.

10.6  Extraction of Data from 3D Files for Display and Transfer
The 3-dimensional (3D) data extraction routines are best used from the
data display and transfer routines.  Here, for example a spectrum
can be extracted from an imaging spectrometer data cube, displayed on
the graphics device and the copy transferred to a regular specpr
format data file for further processing.
IMPORTANT NOTE:
Because of the history mechanism, it is strongly recommended that
you extract data from 3D files in this routine rather than directly
in the math routine.  When a 3D data segment is extracted, a title
and history that describes the exact data set is created.  If the
extraction was done in math as an input to a routine, the math
history generated loses the 3D file origin and will only give the
file name and the first record number (of the extraction sequence).
The proper way to track histories then is to extract the 3D data,
transfer the data to a standard format specpr file and do math
operations, plotting and other functions from the regular specpr
file.

Examples.  If file v is assigned to an AVIRIS imaging spectrometer
data cube containing 512 lines, 614 samples (across track) and 224
bands and you wish to display the spectrum at pixel (line,sample) =
(200,132) you would type

             vpx(200,132,*)

If you wanted to extract a block with the upper left pixel at
200,132 and 3 lines by 5 samples, you would type

             vpx(200+2,132+4,*)

and 15 spectra would be extracted and the error bars (the standard deviation
of the mean) would be computed.
To transfer a copy of the extracted data to a regular specpr file
(which in the example below we will use file w), you would simply do
a transfer using &quot;t&quot;:

             vpx(200+2,132+4,*) t w56.

The result of the 15 pixel average would be copied to file w
record 56 and the error bars put in record 57.
As described in the file assignments chapter (Chapter 6, section
6.2), the extraction direction can be in any one of the 3 orthogonal
directions.  For example, to extract a profile across track (along
the &quot;sample&quot; direction) at line 200, wavelength channel 12, you would
type

             vpx(200,*,12)

and the data would be plotted on the graphics device.
To extract a profile along the flight line at sample 132, wavelength
channel 12, you would type

             vpx(*,132,12)

and the data would be plotted on the graphics device.
