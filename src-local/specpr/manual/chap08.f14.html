F14:  Edits Spectral Data and Error Value                        Alias: edit
This function allows editing of a data set and, if e is
specified at call time, its associated error set as well.

To call f14, specify the file and record number, f14, and, if errors
are desired, e.

Example:

       v317f14e                    or               v317f14

F14 accepts the following formatted commands to perform particular
tasks:

        channel data/e error                            change
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        d[c] channel [channel1 t channel2] c          delete
        i channel                                     insert after
        l channel1 channel2                           list (crt)
        pd                                            print data (lp)
        c                                             continue
                                                       (exit with write)
        e                                             soft exit
        x                                             hard exit
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Note: both e and x terminate the editing session without
              writing the results.  Use &quot;c&quot; to exit and write results.
</pre>

<p>To CHANGE a data value (and its error, or just its
error), specify the channel number of the value to be
changed and the new data value (and the new error value);
should you wish to change only the error, specify the
channel number, e, and the new error value. (If you wish to
change only the data value but you specified e at call time,
you must specify three parameters; the channel number, the
new data value, and the old error value.) Incorrect or
uninterpretable format will cause an error message to be
printed on the terminal screen. (Parameters may be entered
either as integers or as real numbers but not in exponential
format.)</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

v317f14    11 13.567    change channel 11 data value to 13.567
v317f14e   11 13.4 .2   change ch. 11 data to 13.4, error to .2
v317f14e   11 e .2      change ch. 11 error value to .2

                        call time, but no error value was entered)
</pre>
</td>
</table>

<p>To DELETE data values, specify d (or &quot;dc&quot; to
delete and compress); the routine will then accept only
channel number or channel ranges until the parameter c (do
not confuse the parameter c with the option c) is
encountered, at which time the delete task is performed.
Without option c, the data values of all specified channels
will be set to -1.23e+34 (the standard value for SPECPR
deleted points) [and the associated errors will be set to
0.0]. However, if the dc command is specified, the specified
points will first be deleted, and then the channel space
will be compressed to totally eliminate the specified
channels. (Note: Compression of the channel space does not
take effect until all specified points have first been
deleted.) Channel numbers for the points to be deleted may
be specified either individually or as ranges; the character
t specifies a range of channels, starting with (and
including) the number preceding t, and ending with (and
including) the number following t, the command d, [the
option c,] individual channels, channel ranges, and the
parameter c may all be strung together; spaces are required
as delimiters only between two numbers.</p>

<p>To INSERT data [and error] values after a specified
channel, specify i and the channel number after which you
wish to insert values. (If no channel is specified, the
routine defaults to channel 0, in which case the insertions
occur at the start of a spectrum.) The routine will then
accept only data [and error] values, one data [and error]
value per line, until either a blank line or two carriage
returns in a row are encountered; either integers or real
numbers (but not exponential format) are acceptable for data
and errors.</p>

<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>To LIST data and error values on the terminal screen,
specify l and either a channel number or else two channel
limits. Data [and error] values will be listed in
exponential format along with channel numbers. (Spaces are
required as delimiters between limits.) All data values
within the channel limits are listed first; error values
follow.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Example:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<pre>l 1 60    channel number &amp; data value for channels 1 through
          60 are listed on the terminal [followed by channel
          number &amp; error value for channels 1 through 60]

l 5       5 and data value for ch. 5 [and 5 and error value for
          ch. 5] are listed on the terminal
</pre>
</td>
</table>

<p>To PRINT the data [and error] values on the line
printer, specify pd. The output format is the same as when
pd is specified in the CRT plot routine. To CONTINUE
normally and write the edited file, specify the command c;
the routine will exit to the write-to-file routine. Note:
You cannot return to f14 and issue additional commands once
CONTINUE is enacted.) A SOFT or HARD EXIT will occur if at
any time the commands e or x, respectively, are encountered;
control will return to MATH OPERATIONS. (Exception: In
CHANGE, e is not interpreted as an EXIT command if it
follows a channel specification.) IMPORTANT NOTE: This
routine does NOT record a history of the edit commands
performed; should you desire a record of your editing
commands, you must create a manual history yourself.
However, edited changes can be easily seen by comparing with
the original data set which is specified in the history.</p>

<p>Minor notes: All channel numbers should be positive
integers; if a real number is entered by mistake, the
routine will truncate it to integer form. All channel range
limits must list the lower bound first and the upper bound
last. If at any time during this routine you find yourself
lost or confused, try pressing &lt;return&gt; once or twice
until the EDIT COMMAND FORMAT message appears.
Alternatively, you may type e or x to exit f14. You may
insert spaces as delimiters to improve the clarity of
commands; use of such spaces will not affect the operation
of f14.</p>
