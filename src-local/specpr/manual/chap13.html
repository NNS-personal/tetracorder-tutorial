<p align=center>PLOT ROUTINES FOR WORK AND PUBLICATION</p>

<p>13.1 Introduction The specpr hardcopy plot routines are
designed to provide publication quality plots for general
x-y data sets. Specpr builds two intermediate files: a
vector file and a text file. The files are plotter device
independent. Specpr then starts a Unix daemon process that
reads the files and plots the data on a specific plotter.
The daemon process is device dependent. While some users
have written programs to use several different plotters and
even laser printers, the most commonly used plotter is an
HP7550-compatible plotter. This chapter is specific to the
HP-compatible plotters, but will work in general for all
other plotters so far implemented. The plot routines are
called from Program Operations by typing a</p>

</table>

<p>command. When you first enter the routine, the first
command will list the available plotters. This may be site
dependent.</p>

<p>13.2 Plotting Mode Type The first step in setting up a
plot is to select the plot mode. Type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->

<p>to plot in value versus wavelength,</p>

<p>to plot in value inverse wavelength. In this case, you
specify a wavelength set in microns and the plot routines
convert to wavenumber where wavenumber increases to the
right. To plot in wavenumber, as above, but with wavenumber
increasing to the left (reverse of the above mode), type
an</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>r</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. If you want to use your own horizontal axis
label, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>y</p></td>
</table>

<p>(the plot will be linear). You will then be asked to
type in the horizontal axis label (24 characters). For
example, you might type:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>TIME (SECONDS)</p></td>
</table>

<p>or whatever your data correspond to. Thus, you may do
any kind of one-dimensional array processing you wish.</p>

<p>13.2.1 User-selected wavelength limits If you type only
a letter for the plot mode, the horizontal axis is scaled to
the range covered by all the wavelength sets used in the
generation of the plot. However, you may select the
wavelength limits for the plot, regardless of the wavelength
sets used. When you type in the &quot;w&quot; for wavelength
mode (or n, r, or y), also type (on the same line) the
minimum and maximum wavelengths for the plot. Type in
wavelengths the inverse wavelength modes (n and r) also.
Example:</p>
<pre>              w 0.325        2.60
              n 0.325        2.60
              r 0.325        2.60
              y 0.325        2.60
</pre>

<p>The actual limits on the plot will be 2% greater than
the range (maximum-minimum) on each side (see section 13.5
for details). The left bound is then minimum minus 2% of the
maximum-minimum range, and the right bound is the maximum
plus 2% of the maximum-minimum range. You can suppress the
addition of the 2% by adding the option</p>

<p>after the limits. For example,</p>

<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<td width="73%">
<p>w 0.325 2.60n</p></td>
</table>

<p>would keep the actual limits at 0.325 and 2.60. To exit
the plot routine, type an</p>

<p>command anywhere in the routine.</p>

<p>13.3 Vertical Axis Label Several vertical scale labels
are displayed for you to select. They are numbered 1 to n,
where n is currently 8. To select one of these, type in the
number. If you wish to type in your own label, type the
number (currently number 9) that says &quot;type in your own
label,&quot; and you will be instructed to type in a label
of not more than 60 characters. If you wish to plot the
vertical axis in log (base 10) of the input data, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>10</p></td>
</table>

<p>and you must type in your own vertical axis label. The
program will then proceed to the Delete From All Spectra
section. Type</p>

<p>x</p></td>
</table>

<p>to return to the beginning (section 13.1).</p>

<p>13.4 Delete From All Spectra If, from all the spectra
you are going to plot, you wish to delete one or more
channels common to all, type a</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->

<td width="73%">
<p>d</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. You will then be instructed to type in the
channels that will be deleted from all spectra to be
plotted. At least one space should be left between each pair
of channels, and more than one line can be used for input.
All channels may be deleted if desired. When you are
through, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>x</p></td>
</table>

<p>to return to the beginning (section 13.1). When typing
in a sequence of channels, you may give the beginning
channel, a</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>t</p></td>
</table>

<p>and the end channel. For instance, to delete channels 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 23, and 24, you could
type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>d1t8 15t17 23 24c.</p></td>
</table>

<p>13.5 Scale of Plot The vertical scale of the plot is
selected by the user. Type in the lower and upper bounds of
the plot. The plot size is 13.5 centimeters (vertical axis)
by 21.7 centimeters (horizontal axis) for the data plot area
on the HP plotter. However, the plot size does vary somewhat
with other plotters. If your data are to be plotted in log
space on the vertical axis, the lower and upper bounds
should be input as ordinary numbers. The program will
convert the scale limits and data to logs. The scale is then
labeled as the log of the number. Type</p>

<td width="73%">
<p>x</p></td>
</table>

<p>to return to the beginning of the plot routines (section
13.1); otherwise, the program will go to the Plot Scale
Factors section (section 13.6).</p>

<p>13.6 Plot Scale Factors Next you are asked to enter the
plot horizontal and vertical scaling factors. These factors
must be less than 1.0 and scale the size od the data area of
the plot. Thus if the original size of the plot was 17
centimeters high, a vertical scale factor of 0.5 would make
it 8.5 centimeters. These scale factors do not affect the
text or the text size.</p>

<p>13.7 Data Set Input and Options The data sets to be
plotted are input as the file ID (v, w, u, y, or d), the
record number, and the options. For all data sets entered,
the wavelength set must be specified. If it is not,
unpredictable plots can occur. A maximum of 50 spectra may
be plotted at one time. These may be all on one graph or
separated into many plots by an option request. The options
are listed below.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="92%">
<p>Option B means to plot symbols as Black (assuming the
black pen is used on HP compatible plotters), the same color
as the axes labels. The default is to use the same pen color
as the data.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option c means to Connect the data points. If the
wavelengths are not in sequence, or a if channel has been
deleted, the points involved are not connected.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option C means to Always Connect the data points. This
option permits the wavelengths to be NOT in sequence, but
will connect them anyway.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option d means to delete points from this data set only
(as opposed to delete from all data sets as in section
13.4). The program will ask for channels to be typed in when
it is ready. More than one line may be used to input the
channels to be deleted. When you are finished entering
channels, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>c</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>to continue.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option e is include Errors.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option E is include Errors, but only when the error bars
are large enough to be recognized on the plot.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option g means the spectrum after this one is to be
plotted on a new graph. Thus, 50 spectra may be plotted on a
single graph (overlaid), or they may be plotted singly or
any combination. The g (new Gould plot) selects when a new
plot is to begin. The &quot;g&quot; works the same for
non-Gould plotters also.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option l followed by a number 1 through 8 selects the
line color for the plot. The line color for HP-compatible
plotters is the pen number. The default is size 1.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>The line color for some implementations is device daemon
dependent. For the Gould electrostatic plotter this number
represents the line thickness. the axis is fixed at 3. The
number 1, 3, 5, or 7 is the width of the line in Gould
units. Size 1 is about 1/200 of an inch (0.127 mm). The line
size changes error bars and the line connecting points.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option L is the Line type. For HP-compatible plotters it
varies from solid to various dot and line patterns. See
Figure 13.7.1 for specific examples.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option m More copies: In the options, specify
&quot;m&quot; and the number of copies desired (1 to 9)
default=1. Note that you need this option only on the last
spectrum to be put on the plot.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option n means that, if a point lies outside the lower or
upper bound, it should be deleted. If this specification is
not given, the point will be plotted at the limit of the
graph.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option o means to offset the data, followed by the amount
to offset. You can use any positive or negative number. This
number is added to the data before it is plotted. For
example to offset data set v23 with its wavelength set v22,
you could type:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>v23V22o2.2</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>to offset by 2.2 data units.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option p followed by a number is the point size. This
number can be 0 to 5. If the number is zero, no point will
be plotted. Point size 1 is about 1.27mm on a side, size 2
is twice this, size 3 is three times, etc. Note, if point
size zero is specified and points are not connected, no data
will be plotted, and you will have a blank plot! A line
drawing can be made by specifying point size zero and
connecting points. The default point size varies with the
total number of channels per spectrum. It is size 3 for 30
channels or less, size 2 for 31 to 100 channels, and size 1
for more than 100 channels. The symbol type changes with
each spectrum plotted. See Figure 13.7.2.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option r Because mistakes are bound to happen when typing
in all these data sets, you may return to the last step for
re-entering your data. This is done by typing an
&quot;r&quot; in place of a file ID and record number.
Example: You type in the spectra</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>1) &quot;v23eV2p3&quot; 2) &quot;v29eV2p4&quot; 3)
&quot;v30p1c&quot; 4) &quot;v33V5&quot;.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>You now notice the step #3 should have been
&quot;v31V3p1c&quot;. You are at step 5: you type
&quot;r&quot;; the computer says</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>&quot;RETURN TO 4; CONTINUE&quot;.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>You then type &quot;r&quot; again, and the computer
responds</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>&quot;RETURN TO 3; CONTINUE&quot;.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>You may then retype step 3 (and also all steps after 3).
You may not return to a step before the first data set
entered (if you need to, you must &quot;e&quot; or
&quot;x&quot; to exit).</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option s Symbol type: To change symbol type, specify
&quot;s&quot; and the symbol number (1 to 8). See Figure
13.7.2. The symbol size is given by the &quot;p&quot;
specification (point symbol size). The symbol type is
incremented for each spectrum input and is reset to 1 for
each new plot (&quot;g&quot; specification).</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option t means to include text on the graph. Text may be
written as 15 sets of 70 characters per set for each
spectrum entered. The text position is given in centimeters
[horizontal direction (x), then vertical (y)] from the lower
left-hand corner of the axes of the plot. After the x and y
position, input the text angle (90&deg; is horizontal and
0&deg; is vertical) and then the text to be added. When all
text is entered, type a</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>c</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>to continue to the next data set.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Symbols may be plotted using the text mode. Instead of x,
y, degrees, text, you enter</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>s &lt;symbol type&gt; &lt;size&gt; x y</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>where &lt;symbol type&gt; is the symbol described under
the &quot;s&quot; option. The symbol size is also described
under the &quot;s&quot; option.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Terminate entry of the text mode and continue entering
data sets by typing a</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>c</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>command.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Option V, W, D, U or Y followed by a record number sets
the wavelength set to be used (the horizontal axis
values).</p>
</td>
</table>

<p>Notes on Text entry: You may also return to the previous
text entry using the &quot;r&quot; specification as with the
data set input. You may not return to a previous entry
before text entry 1. If you have an error in a previous file
entry, type &quot;c&quot; to continue to next step after
text entry; then return to the last data set input as
described above. The specpr plot routines allow
subscripting, superscripting, backspacing and greek and math
characters in the text. Special characters are used to enter
the different modes and can be used wherever text is written
on the plot (horizontal or vertical axis labels or other
text). The characters are:</p>

<p>It was assumed that these characters would not need to
be printed so they have been reserved for the above special
use. Backslash can be used to cause characters to be
overprinted. An &quot;@&quot; (at sign) terminates the last
use of a brace. All characters in between are printed in
script mode.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>                      A\{1@  Will print as A1

                     SAM\\\___    Will print as ___

</pre>

<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="3" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<p>X}2@-Y Will print as X2 - Y</p>

<p>Typing</p>

<p>e<br>
or<br>
x</p>

<p>in place of a file ID will cause the program to return
to the beginning<br>
of the routine (section 13.1).</p>

<p>Typing</p>

<p>b</p>

<p>will begin building the vector and text files<br>
on the disc. As soon as these files are complete, specpr
starts the<br>
plot daemon job and returns for more input. Thus while the
plotter<br>
is plotting, you may do other tasks, including creating
more<br>
plots.</p>
