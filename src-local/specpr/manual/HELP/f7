     This routine smoothes a spectrum by performing a weighted smoothing  of
adjacent   channels.    First,  the  channels  are  sorted  into  increasing
wavelengths; note that the smoothing is done in  channel  space  only.   The
user  then  chooses  how  many channels to include on each side of each data
point.  Each point is weighted by the inverse power  of  2  with  the  power
increasing  with increasing distance from the data point to be smoothed.  If
the parameter giving the number of channels to include on  each  side  of  a
given channel is n, then for n = 1 data point D at channel i is computed by

                   D9i8 = [ 1/2D9i-18 +  D9i8  +  1/2D9i+18]/2.                 (eqn
                   8.f7.1)

For n = 2

            D9i8 = [ 1/4D9i-28 + 1/2D9i-18 + D9i8 + 1/2D9i+18  1/4D9i+28]/2.5.      (eqn
            8.f7.2)

     The parameter n can vary from 1 to the number of channels divided by 2.
When the smoothing is finished, the data are sorted into the original order.
The wavelength record default is the current wavelength set in use  (and  is
printed  on  the  CRT).   If  another  wavelength  set  is desired, type the
wavelength file id and record number on the same line  as  the  parameter  n
(which must be first on the line).  Also, if data only in a certain range is
to be considered, on the same line, type an "l" command (for limit) and  the
range limits:

              _l _n_1 _n_2






where n1 and n2 are the minimum and maximum data  numbers  to  be  included.
Default limits on l are -1.0x108349 to +1.0x108349.

     For example, the following command (all on one line):

               _2 _V_1_5 _l -_5_0 _3_0_0_0_0

sets the n = 2, wavelength set V15, and set limits to be -50 to 30,000.

     If certain channels should be deleted, type

              _d

to delete points.  You will then be asked  to  type  in  the  points  to  be
deleted.  When you are finished typing in points to be deleted, type

              _c

to continue.

     A data set must be specified before the f7 command, and errors  can  be
included.   The  parameter n seems to give excellent results when it is 1 or
2.  When n gets larger, there seems little difference in the smoothed result
compared to smoothed data with n=2.
