     All mathematical operations are carried out in Math  Operations  except
for  extinction analysis.  The math routines also contain the "special func-
tions."  Special functions do some operation on a data set,  or  generate  a
data  set.   While most special functions are math related, they need not be
(for example sort a data set  into  increasing  wavelengths).   The  general
sequence the user sees in the Math Operations section is the following:


        o+  At the math main menu, the user  enters  a
           math command

        o+  The math  function  displays  what  it  is
           going to do and the user works his/her way
           through the function-specific menus.

        o+  When the math function completes normally,
           the user is asked where the data should be
           written (which v, w, d, u, or y data  file
           and what record number).  The data are not
           written at this time; that is  the  second
           to last step below.  The ultimate location
           is requested at this  point  so  that  the
           spectrum  is  properly  identified in case
           print-outs are made.

        o+  The user is asked to type in  a  title  to
           the data set.

        o+  The data are plotted in the graphics  ter-
           minal  (with  the  crt  plot routines, see
           Chapter 9).  In the crt plot routines, the
           user  can  change  or  add  to  the header
           information.

        o+  The data are written to the data file when
           the user soft exits from the crt plot rou-
           tines (exit with  e).   See  warnings  and
           important rules below.

        o+  The user is returned to  the  math  opera-
           tions menu.

        For example, if you  divide  two  spectra  in
        data  file "w", and write the results in data
        file  "v",  use  a  wavelength  set  that  is
        already in "v".  Thus if:

              w 10 = wavelengths with 56 channels
              w 11 = data set "a"
              w 12 = data set "b"

        and you want to divide w11 by w12, first  put
        a  copy of w10 into the "v" file (see Chapter
        10 on how to copy/transfer), then assign  the
        "v"  wavelength  set  before you do the divi-
        sion.  The wavelength pointer  will  then  be
        set  automatically  when the results from the
        math operation are written to the v-file.

     One entire line (80  characters)  of  commands  may  be  typed  in  for
execution.  Each math command must be separated by a comma.

        Example:

                   _w_1_1/_w_1_2,_v_2_3*_c_5._6_2_e,_y_2_3_6/_w_1_2

After each math operation is completed, the next com-
mand is executed without returning to the math menu.

     The information in the Math menu can be turned off by typing

                    _i_n

or turned back on by typing

                    _i

and nothing else on the command line.

     The production processing option stops only to request  the  title  and
writes  the  result to device v without doing the CRT plot.  This option (p)
makes processing equivalent to the time spent in performing  batch  process-
ing.   When  you  enter the output title (section 8.8), you may turn off (or
on) production processing by typing "pn" (or "po" for on) after  the  title.
See section 8.8.

     The _c in place of the second file ID is for constant.  The value of the
constant is then placed where the second record number is located.

               Example:

              w10-11, w12-13, v10*c1.3, v23/46eb, v12-d10np bn

Here file w record 11 is subtracted from 10 (the  default  when  the  second
file ID is left out is the first file ID).  Next w13 is subtracted from w12,
then v10 is multiplied by the constant 1.3, next v23 is divided by v46  with
1  sigma  standard deviation (errors) included and also a band normalization
performed.

     On the math command line, spaces may be included at  any  point  except
within  a number, or they may be completely left out.  The program processes
the commands sequentially.  When  performing  each  operation,  the  program
enters  the appropriate routine, writes the titles of the requested files on
the CRT, and pauses for a continue command (unless the Production option has
been set).  If you type

              _x

here, the program exits directly to math operations.  If you type

              _e

the program exits that operation and begins processing of the next operation
if  one exists.  The production option is set to no production at the end of
each operation whereas the band normalization option stays on  until  turned
off by a

              _b_n

command.

     When the operation is completed, the program goes to section 8.1.

     Math Operations can be used to change the wavelength file set  in  use.
Example:

              _v_2_3/_v_4_5_V_2, _v_8_6*_v_2_7_W_4_6

where the capital file ID specifies a wavelength set within the  correspond-
ing  data  file.   The  number of channels in use will then be read from the
wavelength set.

     Normal subtraction calculates airmass based on the coordinates found in
the  first  13  characters  of  the  title of the first input file; if these
coordinates are not entered in the correct format (HHMMSS+DDMMSS no  spaces,
declination  sign must be explicitly specified as plus or minus, and any one
of the first six digits must be non-zero), the routine issues the command

          TYPE IN RIGHT ASCENSION AND DECLINATION

and awaits a correct response.  The routine repeats  this  message  until  a
correct  response  is  encountered--e  and x are NOT correct responses.  The
correct response is up to six numbers separated by spaces, any  one  of  the
first  three of which must be non-zero, the fourth of which should be signed
only if negative, and all the rest of which should be unsigned.

TO GET OUT OF THIS LOOP, enter any single non-zero number, and type e  or  x
at the next possible opportunity.

(This format may be confusing because the interpretation  routine  from  the
first  13 characters requires an explicitly specified plus or minus sign for
the declination, and the request  for  RA  and  DEC  cannot  interpret  plus

     The addition routine can add from 2 to 128  spectra  with  deletion  of
zeros  or  requested points.  To access the addition routine, type + and any
options:

              +     no options
              +e    addition with propagation of existing error bars
              +s    sum
              +a    average
              +se   sum with errors
              +ae   average with errors

with no other math operations after that on the  input  line  (because  they
will  not be processed due to a programming restriction).  Upon entering the
addition routine, you will be asked whether  you  want  to  average  or  sum
(unless you specified the a or s option as given above).  Type

              a    to Average,
              s    to Sum and,

Next type:

              z   to DELETE ZEROS in the input data,
              v   to DELETE data values outside a user set limit, and/or
              s   to DELETE data values outside a certain standard deviation limit.


Next you will be given instructions on entering the files  to  be  added  or
summed.   Type  in  the  file ID [v, w, d, u, y or c (for constant)] and the
record number or constant.

     If you wish to delete points from this record, type d after the  record
number  or  constant.   If  you  elect to delete channels, you may start the
channel number list after the "d".  You may use more than one line to  input
these  numbers,  but each channel to be deleted from the sum or average must
be listed.  When you are through entering numbers to be deleted, type a  "c"
to continue.

     Example:

              _v_2_3                    \# _n_o_r_m_a_l _i_n_p_u_t, _n_o _d_e_l_e_t_i_o_n_s,

     Error analyses are included in addition, multiplication  and  division,
and  subtraction and many of the special functions (see individual functions
- section 8.6) In all cases of error analysis, the data  numbers  should  be
within the range of

               1.0x108-159 to 1.0x108+15

9to avoid overflow.  If overflow occurs, the error is set to  zero.   If  the
data is zero in the multiplication or division routines, when using the pro-
pagation of errors, the error is set to zero for that channel.   The  errors
represent 1 sigma standard deviation of the mean and are normally first com-
puted in the addition routine as a standard deviation of the  mean  computa-
tion.  The equations used in propagating errors are as follows:  .KE

     A complete set of algebraic, trigonometric, and power functions  exists
similar  to those on a scientific calculator.  No error analysis is included
with any of these functions.  The functions are accessed by  file  ID,  file
number, colon (:), and the name of the function.  Functions are:

                             Exponential:  exp
                       Natural logarithm:  ln
                        Common logarithm:  log
                   Ten to spectrum power:  10**x
                                 Inverse:  1/x
          Spectrum to the constant power:  x**c
          Constant to the spectrum power:  c**x
                       Sine (in radians):  sin
                     Cosine (in radians):  cos
                    Tangent (in radians):  tan
                       Sine (in degrees):  sind

                Inverse cosine (radians):  invcos
               Inverse tangent (radians):  invtan
                  Inverse sine (degrees):  invsind
                Inverse cosine (degrees):  invcosd
               Inverse tangent (degrees):  invtand

             Hyperbolic cosine (radians):  cosh
            Hyperbolic tangent (radians):  tanh
                          Absolute value:  abs
                           Integer value:  int
                         Fractional part:  frac

Examples:

              _v_3_9_7:_l_n       \# _n_a_t_u_r_a_l _l_o_g _o_f _v_3_9_7

     In both the spectrum to the constant power and constant to the spectrum
power, the value of the constant is after the command (x**c or c**x):

              _v_3_9_7:_x**_c_3._6_5       \# _v_3_9_7 _t_o _t_h_e _3._6_5 _p_o_w_e_r,

No options are valid with any of these operations including  errors  (except
1/x  can  include  errors),  band  normalization, and production processing.
This is due to programming limits (there has to be some).  Since these  rou-
tines  are not used too often, this should make little difference.  What are
they used for?  Normal spectral processing does not need them, but  say  you
wanted to make a plot of a phase function for a Lambert sphere:


                                                                 (eqn 8.5.1)

     You could generate data for A increasing  from  0  to  1808o9  using  the
wavelength  routines  and  then this function using the math functions.  The
result can then be plotted on the Gould printer plotter using the plot  rou-
tines.

     Special function subroutines are additional routines for  operating  on
any  kind  of  data.  They do any operation: for example a data list, a data
editor, or a specific computation.  Some special functions operate on a data
set  (for  example, a smoothing function) while others may create a new data
set (for example, read one from an ascii text file  or  digitize  one  on  a
digitizing tablet, or simply compute one, like a Plank black body).

     Special functions are  called  from  math  operations  by  one  of  two
methods,  depending  on  whether or not the function operates on an existing
data set.  If a function requires a data set, you enter the file id,  record
number,  an  "f"  followed  by  the function number.  For example, to smooth
(function 7) data set v23, you would enter the command:

              _v_2_3_f_7

Special functions also have alias names.  For example, the  smoothing  func-
tion f7 has the alias "smooth".  Thus

              _v_2_3_f_7
and
              _v_2_3_s_m_o_o_t_h

are equivalent.

     Some special functions do not need an input data set.   In  that  case,
just  specify  the  function or its alias.  For example, to compute a Planck
black body, type:

              _f_6
or
              _p_l_a_n_c_k

and the function will be started.

     Note there is no colon in the command line  for  special  functions  as
compared to the algebraic and trig routines.

     Special function 1 is a function which lists a catalog of all available
special  functions.   Just  type "f1" from the math operations command line.
This list contains a code at the end of the short description which tells if
the  function  needs  a  data  file input before the function on the command
line.  If this is the case, you will see an "(f)" at the end of the descrip-
tion.  If the function can also propagate the error bars to the data set, it
will have an "(f,e)" at the end of the description.

     To  propagate  error  bars  for  those  routines  that  support   error

propagation,  you must specify an "e" option on the command line.  For exam-
ple, to propagate error bars in  the  cubic  spline  interpolation  routine,
function f12, alias cspline, and operate on data set v23, type the command:

              _v_2_3_f_1_2_e
or
              _v_2_3_c_s_p_l_i_n_e _e


Specpr is designed  to  add  special  functions  easily.   Subroutine  calls
already exist in the program for many as yet unwritten routines.  These rou-
tines are designed for easy linking to the present  program.   New  routines
can  be  user  written  with  less effort than a completely separate program
since, in most cases, SPECPR handles all the data management.



8.7  Return from a Math Operation or Function

     When a routine such as addition, subtraction, special  function,  trig.
function,  etc., has finished, the program asks the user where he/she wishes
the data to be written.  The data can be written to any of the files:  v, w,
d, u, or y if allowed by the protection.  If the protection on the device is
positive or zero, the data can only be written to the protection value  plus
1.   Thus,  it  is  not necessary to type in this value since it is the only
value possible.  Simply type the file  letter  ID  and  return;  the  record
number will be set automatically.

     The data set is not written at this point.  It is written after the CRT
plot  routines.   The  user  may  also  exit the current operation from this
point.  By typing

              _e

the current operation is terminated and the program begins execution of  the
next  command  if there is one or returns to Math Operations if there are no
other command requests.  If the user types

              _x

all processing stops, and the program returns directly to Math Operations.

     If the user requests the data to be stored, then the program  continues
to the titles routine (section 8.8).

     The titles routine displays 2 titles on the CRT which may  be  selected
for  the  new  data, or one of 25 user stored titles can be recalled, or the
user can type in a new title and store it.  The 2 titles  displayed  are  as
follows.

The "option p title"    This is the "present title" of the  first  data  set
                        read  in  for  2 file operations or the title of the
                        last data set in the addition routine or many  other
                        routines.   Some  special  functions  may generate a
                        suggested present title.

The "option l title"    This is the title requested for the last operation.


     In the subtraction routine, the program decodes an  "object-sky"  title
as  the  option p title.  This is based on inputs from the "Wedge" CVF spec-
trometer data system and may not be valid with other types of subtraction.

     All titles are 40 characters long, so to  select  the  option  p  or  l
titles, type

              _p
or
              _l

with no other characters in columns to 40.  To  recall  one  of  the  stored
titles, type

              _t#

where the "#" is the title number (1 to 25).  There can be no other  charac-
ters in columns 1 to 40.  If other characters are detected here, the program
will think this is a new title and use it.  The title used, whether recalled
or new, is stored in title file t1.  To list the contents of the title file,
type

              _t_l

with no other characters on the command line.  The titles will be listed and
the program will again ask for a title.

     Once a title has been selected (recalled or new), further commands  can
be placed in columns 40 or greater.  To store a title, type

              _t#

where the "#" is the title number (3 to 25 are valid).  Remember,  the  "t#"
must  be  positioned  in  columns  41  or  greater  with the requested title
(recalled or new) in columns 1 through 40.

     The Band normalization or Production processing  options  can  also  be
turned on or off by control characters in columns 41 or greater.  Type



                             February 20, 2002

              _b

to turn on or

              _b_n

to turn off Band normalization.  Type

              _p

to turn on or

              _p_n

to turn off the Production processing option (the n is for none).

     The vertical scale of the pending crt plot can also  be  changed  after
column 41 of the title command line.  Simply type "c and the lower and upper
range.  For example, to change the scale from 0.92 to 1.63, type

              _c _0._9_2 _1._6_3

after column 41.

     An example of a complete title entry would be

              _S_c_a_p_o_l_i_t_e _H_S_3_5_1 / _H_a_l_o_n _4_x _r_e_s_o_l ._2-_3_u_m   _t_5 _b _c ._5 _1._5

which means to make the title of the current data  set  "Scapolite  HS351  /
Halon  4x resol .2-3um", store it in title location 5, turn on band normali-
zation and change scale of the pending CRT plot to lower bound 0.5 and upper
bound 1.5.

     The current operation can be terminated as in section 8.7 by typing

              _e
or
              _x

with no other characters on the line.  Typing "e" will terminate the present
operation,  and  the  program will begin the next operation if there is one.
Otherwise, it will return to Math Operations.  Typing "x" will terminate all
operations and will go directly to Math Operations.

     If a title is requested, the program will then go to the Band  Normali-
zation  Routine  (section  8.9) if the Band Normalization option is on or to
the CRT plot routines if the Band Normalization and Production  options  are
off.   If  the Production and Band Normalization options are on, the program
will go to the Band Normalization; otherwise, if only the Production  option
is on it will write the data and begin processing the next command.

8.9  Band Normalization

     The Band Normalization is a least squares analysis over a user selected
band  with the spectrum scaled so the middle of the band is scaled to unity.
The band can be one channel or however many channels are  in  the  spectrum.
The  Band  Normalization  routine is called after each operation if the Band
Normalization option is on.

     When you are in  the  band  normalization  routine,  you  have  several
options to control the region that will be normalized.

     Channels can be deleted inside the region of  normalization  by  typing
the

              _d

command.  The program then asks for the points.  One line can be filled with
points to be deleted (numbers, no characters).

     The band limits can be moved by typing the

              _m

command.  Deleted channels can be reinserted by typing the

              _r

command.

     The band area with the fitted line along with the  correlation  coeffi-
cient,  the  previous Band Normalization factor (the normalization factor of
the data before this normalization), the current  normalization  factor  (as
determined  by  this normalization), and the future normalization factor (if
this normalization is carried out) are plotted on the CRT.  The future  nor-
malization factor equals the previous times the current factors.

     _W_A_R_N_I_N_G: _i_f _t_h_e _p_r_e_v_i_o_u_s _n_o_r_m_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n _f_a_c_t_o_r _w_a_s _z_e_r_o  _w_h_e_n  _t_h_e  _B_a_n_d

     To perform the normalization of the data, type

              _b

otherwise, type

              _e

to exit the routine without changing the normalization factor.  The "e" soft
exit  continues to the next step which will normally be the CRT plot routine
unless production processing is turned  on.   If  production  processing  is
turned  on,  the  specpr will write the data when exiting band normalization
with an "e" soft exit.

     A hard exit, command "x" from  the  Band  Normalization  routine,  will

terminate  all  pending  commands  and return to the Math Operations command
line.

     Default Band Normalization limits when program is begun are 30 to 38.
