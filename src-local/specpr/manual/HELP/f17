     Routine f17 convolves a high resolution data set to  a  low  resolution
data  set.   It  has  2  modes:   1)  use Gaussian profiles whose widths and
centers are specified by the user, or 2) use user-specified filter profiles.
The  routine  outputs  two  data  sets:  (1) the resultant wavelength values
(center values) and (2) the convolved spectrum.  The output  of  the  center
values  is  optional.   A  typical use would be to use mode 1 (Gaussian pro-
files) for convolving one spectrometer to another, and mode 2 for convolving
a spectrum to a specific filter response, such as a LANDSAT TM system.

     To run the function, go to the math routines and enter the file ID  and
number for the input spectrum and f17.  Example:

              _v_2_3_f_1_7
or
              _v_2_3_c_o_n_v


     The routine starts with a query for the use of the  default  wavelength
assignment,  which  is  displayed  at  the top of the screen.  To change the
default assignment, enter the wavelength data set file ID (upper  case)  and
the  record  number.   If  you don't want to change the wavelength set, just
type return.

     Next you will be asked whether you want to normalize the data.  This is
a  convolution  normalization.   Normally  you  want  to  do  this.   If you
normalize,the resulting spectrum is divided by a  convolved  spectrum  whose
input data values are all one.  If you don't normalize, the convolution out-
put will vary as a function of the area under the  curve  of  each  response
function.   Unnormalized convolutions can be used for tracking voltages from
a sensor.  If you simply want to compare the spectral  response,  calibrated
to,  say,  radiance  or  reflectance,  and your input data are calibrated in
those units, you want to normalize the convolution.

     Next you are asked if you want to use the Gaussian mode or  the  filter
bandpass mode.  Type:

              g           Gaussian mode.
              <return>    bandpass filter mode.

_G_a_u_s_s_i_a_n _P_r_o_f_i_l_e _C_o_n_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n

     You are first asked for a data set describing the center values of  the
Gaussians  for  the  output data set (these are the wavelengths you are con-
volving to).  Enter the file ID and record number of the data set.

     Next you are prompted to enter the Gaussian bandwidths.  These are  the
Gaussian  Full  Width  at  Half Maxima (FWHM) for each Gaussian center value
entered in the previous step.  Enter the file ID and the  record  number  of
this  data  set.   The  Gaussian  bandwidth data set and the Gaussian center





values _m_u_s_t have the same number of channels.

     Next your are asked to input the bandwidths of the input data set.  The
spectral resolution of the input data set must be known to properly convolve
to the output data set.  Enter the file ID and record number  of  the  input
spectrum resolution.  This data set must have the same number of channels as
the input wavelength data set in use.

     The convolution routine computes the convolution and then asks  if  you
want to output the center wavelengths.  See below.


_B_a_n_d_p_a_s_s _F_i_l_t_e_r _C_o_n_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n

     If you selected the  bandpass  filter  convolution  mode,  the  routine
prompts  you  for the first filter profile and asks how many filters will be
convolved.  Each filter profile produces one  output  channel.   The  filter
profile  must  be sampled at the wavelengths of the input data set (if it is
not, you could reinterpolate them using a routine  like  the  cubic  spline,
f12).  For example, say you were convolving a laboratory spectrum of kaolin-
ite to LANDSAT TM filters (7 bands).  Say the filter response function  sam-
pled  at  the wavelengths of the laboratory spectrum was at w46 (the other 6
filters must be sequentially located in the same data file).  You would then
type:

              _w_4_6 _7

The input filter response functions are read in and the output  spectrum  is
calculated.   Next  the user is asked if the output of center wavelengths is
desired.

_C_e_n_t_e_r _W_a_v_e_l_e_n_g_t_h_s

     After the convolution is complete (either Gaussian  or  bandpass  mode)
you  are  queried  on whether or not to output the center value wavelengths.
If you wish to write the center values, type  in  the  file  id  and  record
number of the file where you wish to write the center values, or type return
to ignore writing the center values.  Next enter the title  for  the  center
values  when prompted.  Because this is an output data set (like any other),
use a _l_o_w_e_r _c_a_s_e file id(not upper case).


     Note that f17 cannot include errors in its calculations.  However,  you
can do error propagation by simply convolving the error data set in the same
manner as the regular data set.

The equation used to calculate the spline is


                    R9j8 = ^9x9o77x9l99 S B9j8 dx,                       (eqn 8.f17.1)


where R9j8 is a data point in the resultant spectrum, x9o8 is the first value of
the  input  spectrum,  x9l8  is the last value of the input spectrum, S is the





input spectrum, and B9j8 is the spectral bandpasses.

     The center values are calculated by the following:

                    C9j8 = ^9x9o77x9l99 x S B9j8 dx,                    (eqn 8.f17.2)


     where C9j8 is the center value for that particular spectral bandpass, x9l8,
S, B9j8 and x9o8 are the same as in equation 8.f17.2, and x is the wavelength.

     The integrals are approximated by using numerical integration  by  sum-
ming  the  rectangular  segments.   Each  rectangle is computed by using the
channel separation of the input spectrum:

               n
          R9j8 = R  S9i8 B9j,i8 Dx9i8,                        (eqn 8.f17.3)
              i=1

where n is the number of channels and Dx9i8 is the spectral bandpass of  chan-
nel i

                |  x928 - x918,      i = 1
                |
          Dx9i8 = |  x9i+18 - x9i-18,  1 < i < n                      (eqn 8.f17.4)
                |
                |  x9n-18 - x9n8,    i = n

Similarly, the center values (wavelength) of each convolved channel are com-
puted from the equation

               n
               R x9i8 S9i8 B9j,i8 Dx9i8    (eqn 8.f17.3)
              i=1
          C9j8 = -----------------
                        R9j

     During the calculations, divide  operations  are  checked  for  a  zero
denominator.  If this happens, an error message is printed for the user, and
the denominator is reset to 1.0x108-369 instead of crashing the program.

     If no file has been input to the program at the start, an error message
will be printed, and the routine exits.

     Note that if the number of bandpass files times five  is  greater  than
the  number  of channels, a warning message will be printed explaining that,
with data arranged in such a manner, the resulting accuracy of the  data  is
questionable.   This  is due to using the summations (equations 3 and 5) and
the equation 4  to  approximate  the  integrals.   The  message  is  only  a
warning--you  must determine if the bandpasses are complex enough that accu-
racy may actually be in error due to a small sample.

is  close  to the input spectral resolution, you may want to interpolate the





input spectra to finer channel spacing.  Because the  numerical  integration
rectangles  are  controlled  by  the channel spacing, interpolating to finer
spacing will increase the accuracy of the numerical integration.   You  must
interpolate  both  the  input  spectra  and the resolution "spectrum" to the
finer wavelength set.  Remember, for example, if you had  0.001  Mm  spacing
and  0.001  Mm  resolution,  and  you interpolated to 0.0001 Mm spacing, the
resolution is still only 0.001 Mm, thus the spectrum is  oversampled.   This
oversampling  is  only  useful  in terms of making the numerical integration
more accurate.  If your convolved spectra show a "staircase" effect,  it  is
an  indication of the limitation of the numerical integration and you should
resample the input data to finer spacing.
