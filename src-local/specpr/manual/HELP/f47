     This routine reads specpr f46 spectral features output and attempts  to
use  the  feature parameters to compute the original spectrum.  The features
are triangular in shape at the bottom because  straight  line  segments  are
used  from the band center to the Full width at Quarter Maximum and the Full
width at Half Maximum and to the continuum level.  The routine is useful  to
see how well the f45 automated band analysis routine works.

     In the initial evaluation of f45, this routine proved useful.  The  key
in  evaluating  the  output  is the question "is the spectrum identifiable?"
For example, do the features for the spectrum of kaolinite  get  reassembled
into  a spectrum that is recognizable as kaolinite?  The authors tested many
spectra and concluded "yes."
