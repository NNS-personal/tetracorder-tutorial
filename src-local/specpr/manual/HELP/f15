     _N_O_T_E: At this version of specpr, GFIT is not implemented beyond  specpr
version  1.   However,  f15  is  still included to format Gaussian parameter
files from GFIT output done for those sites still running version  1  specpr
and GFIT.  A future implementation of specpr may include GFIT.

     This routine takes GFIT data from the SPECPR files and formats the data
in  a neat, legible manner.  If no file was input, an error message is writ-
ten, and the routine soft exits.  The routine also checks to make sure  that
the input file is of the the correct type.  If not, the routine soft exits.

     First, the routine writes out the Gaussian terms (if  there  are  any),
followed  by  the  continuum terms (if there are any); these are followed by
the integrated intensities which are equal to the height times the width  of
the Gaussian, the percent error of the Gaussians, the mean value and sigma.

     The routine then checks the manual history to see if  the  fit  was  in
inverse  wavelength  space  or  natural  logarithm space.  If the fit was in
inverse wavelength space, then the data are converted  to  wavelength  space
for the center positions and widths.  If the fit was done in log space, then
the items printed are

     (1) the relative band depth which is equal to 1 - EXP (Height),
     (2) Band depth - Error = 1 - EXP (Height - Error) and
     (3) Band depth + Error = 1 - EXP (Height + Error).

In all divisions, the denominator is checked for zero.  If it is zero, it is
reset to 1.0x108-369, and an error message is printed on user's terminal.
