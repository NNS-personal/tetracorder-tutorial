     This routine reads specpr data records produced from the Automated Band
Analysis  routine,  f45,  and  outputs the data to a binary file in order to
generate  a  spectral  features  data   base.    The   independent   program
"spfeatures" reads the data base created by this routine.

     In addition to the features, this routine adds the title  and  spectral
identification  (specpr  file name and record number) to the features binary
data base.
