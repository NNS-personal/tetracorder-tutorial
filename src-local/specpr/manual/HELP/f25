     This special function computes the best areal mixture  of  two  "known"
spectra  as  compared to an observed spectrum.  The user provides his or her
own guess as to what the end-member spectra are and the routine computes the
least squares fit of the two.

     _W_A_R_N_I_N_G: This routine was a developmental version at the University  of
Hawaii  and  has  never been certified as to its method.  It currently works
for spectra without error bars and with channels less than or equal to  256.
If you do use this routine, you must verify for yourself the accuracy of the
method.  A full manual entry is waiting on proper certification of this rou-
tine.
