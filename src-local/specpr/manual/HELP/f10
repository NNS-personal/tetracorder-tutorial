_F_1_0:  _S_o_r_t_i_n_g _R_o_u_t_i_n_e                                     _A_l_i_a_s: _s_o_r_t

     The function arranges data into increasing wavelength order.  Entry  is
by the usual method for special functions: from the math routines, enter the
file id and record number of the data set  or  be  sorted.   Errors  may  be
included by an "e" option on the math command line.

     After entering the sort routine, the title of the data set to be sorted
is  printed  along  with the wavelength set in use.  The user may change the
wavelength set at this point by entering the (upper case) file id and record
number of the wavelength set.

     _W_A_R_N_I_N_G: Only the data file is sorted, but by specifying the wavelength
file when calling f10, the wavelengths may be sorted also.

     For example, say the wavelengths are in v3 and the data in  v6.   First
sort the wavelength set.  From math operations, type the

              _v_3_f_1_0
or
              _v_3_s_o_r_t

command.  Once inside the sort routine, set  the  wavelength  set,  in  this
example to the:

              _V_3

wavelength set.

     Once the wavelengths are sorted, sort the data set v6:

              _v_6_s_o_r_t

and once inside you should not have to set the wavelength set again  because
V3 should already be in use.  Simply press return to sort the data.
