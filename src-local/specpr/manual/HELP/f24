     This routine removes the thermal component from the  reflectance  of  a
lunar spectrum using a standard star as a reference.  This routine was writ-
ten by the University of Hawaii, Planetary Geosciences Division as a modifi-
cation  to  special  function 11 (Lunar Thermal Removal, page 8-f11.1).  See
that manual page for related operation.  The specific manual page  for  this
function will be written by people at the UH.
