     Protective Locks are enforced to prevent more than one user at  a  time
from  running  specpr in a directory.  When specpr is started, a file called
LOCK.specpr is created in the directory.  If another specpr is  started,  it
will see that file and give you a message and quit.  You should check to see
if a user is really running specpr, and even ask him or her why the lock  is
still  there  if  specpr is no longer being run (maybe specpr was terminated
abnormally).  If no one is running specpr, then you may delete the lock file
and  proceed  as  normal.  When specpr terminates normally, the lock will be
deleted.  If specpr crashes, the lock will still be deleted because the lock
activities are done in the startup shell for specpr.
