     This function computes the Planck black body function at a  given  tem-
perature  (in degrees Kelvin) and any wavelength set.  Currently, the output
is in watts per  square  meter  per  micron  per  steradian  and  the  input
wavelength set is assumed to be in microns.

     Upon entering the routine, you are asked to type in the temperature and
the  wavelength  id  and  record number.  When using extreme temperatures or
extreme wavelengths, you should check the results for underflow or  overflow
in  the  CRT  plot routines (Chapter 9).  No file or errors are needed since
this routine generates a new file instead of an operation  on  an  old  one.
The equation used is


                                                                        (eqn

where E is the energy for each channel at wavelength,
      L (in microns),
      T is the temperature (degrees Kelvin),
      c is the speed of light,
      h is the Planck constant (= 6.6252x108-349 Joule-seconds),

  and k is the Boltzmann constant (= 1.3806x108-239 Joule/8o9K).
