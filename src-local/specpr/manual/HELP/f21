     This routine calculates nth term polynomials where the  maximum  number
of  terms  or  coefficients  is  256.  This routine operates on the data set
entered from math operations.  Then it prompts you for a data set of coeffi-
cients (file ID and record number) for the polynomial:

                    Y(n) = C(1) + C(2)X(n) + C(3)X(n)829 + C(4)X(n)839 + ...,

where Y is the output array, X is the input  array,  C  is  the  coefficient
array.

     To execute the f21 function, in math operations type the  file  id  and
record number of the input file and f21.  For example:

              _v_2_3_f_2_1
or
              _v_2_3_c_a_l_c

After the routine title is printed type in the file id and record number  of
the file containing the coefficient values, then a space, then the number of
terms of the polynomial.  For example, if the coefficients were in  v24  and
there were 6 coefficients, you would type:

              _v_2_4 _6


     The program will then do the calculations and return to the  math  rou-
tine  prompting  you  for  the location to put the output file and the title
etc.


     _W_A_R_N_I_N_G: be careful of overflows!  When the number of terms, n, becomes
large (like near or greater than 10), x8n9 can get very large if x > 1.0.
