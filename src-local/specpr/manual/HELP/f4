     This function sets up the commands from function f3 for  execution  and
thus has no user access.

     The f4 function makes a command to do an operation followed by a  comma
and f4.  Thus f4 calls itself.  Internally, it stores the sequential command
and counters in an internal array and increments them each time the  program
returns  to  the  f4 function.  For example, f4 may build a command sequence
like

              _v_2_3/_w_2_6_e,_f_4

so that the first operation (v23/w26e) is done and then f4 is called  again.
The f4 routine then increments whatever the user had requested and generates
a new command and returns to the command interpreter.

     When all incrementing is complete, f4 returns to the user command input
routine.
