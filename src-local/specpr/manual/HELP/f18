     Special function f18 averages data blocks into single data channels and
computes  the  statistics  (standard  deviation of the mean) for each block.
The size of the block is defined by the user.  The blocks can be a number of
channels,  or  a  range from the wavelength set.  The blocks can be overlap-
ping, as in Nyquist sampling, or contiguous (half Nyquist sampling).

     To start f18, you must supply a data set  from  math  operations.   For
example, from math, type:

              _v_2_3_f_1_8
or
              _v_2_3_b_l_o_c_k


     As in most specpr routines, when you first enter f18, the title of  the
current  data  set  being operated on is displayed along with the wavelength
set in use and the number of channels.  You may change the wavelength set in
use  at  this  point  by typing in the new wavelength set file ID(upper case
letter)and the record number.  If you do not wish to change  the  wavelength
set, press return.

     Next you will be asked if you want the blocks defined  as  channels  or
wavelengths.  Type:

              c    to define block in units of channels, or
              w    to define blocks in units of the wavelength set.


     Now you are asked to enter the block size.  If in channel  mode,  enter
the number of channels to be averaged in each block.  If in wavelength mode,
enter the wavelength range in the same units as your  wavelength  set.   For
example,  if you have a wavelength set going from 0.3 to 2.5 Mm and you want
blocks of 0.1 Mm, enter 0.1 (be sure you are in wavelength mode).  The block
size  must  be less than or equal to the number of channels in channel mode,
or less than or equal to the upper end of the wavelength range.

     The block always starts at 0 and in  includes  the  upper  end  of  the
block.  For example, in channel mode a block size of 5 will include channels
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  In wavelength mode, a block size of 0.1 will include all
channels whose wavelengths fall from 0.00 to 0.10.

     Next you are asked for half or full Nyquist sampling. Enter

              h    for half Nyquist sampling, or
              f    for full Nyquist sampling.

Say the block size is 6 and you select full Nyquist sampling.  The input  to
each block would be as follows:






              Input channels               Output channel
              -------------------------------------------
              (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6                    1
              (4+5+6+7+8+9)/6                    2
              (7+8+9+10+11+12)/6                 3
              (10+11+12+13+14+15)                4
              (13+14+15+16+17+18)/6              5
              -------------------------------------------

However, for half Nyquist sampling, the input would be:

              Input channels               Output channel
              -------------------------------------------
              (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6                    1
              (7+8+9+10+11+12)/6                 2
              (13+14+15+16+17+18)/6              3
              -------------------------------------------


     The average of a block j is computed from the equation

                           n92
9                           R  x9i
8                          i=n91
8                    x9j8 = ---------------
                          (n928 - n918 + 1)


     where (n918 - n928 +1) = N if n928 is less than or equal  to  the  number  of
channels.

     If errors have been included, the standard deviation is  calculated  by
the following

                          |  n928     | 1/2
                          |         |
                          |  R  Y9i729 |
                          | i=n918    |
                          |         |
                    Y8_99j8 = --------------
                         (n928 - n918 + 1)


     where Y9j8 is the new standard deviation.  If the errors  have  not  been
read in, the following equation is used:













                          |  n928   (x9j8 - x8_99j8)829   |
                          |                    |
                          |  S   ------------- |
                          | i=n918 (n928 - n918 + 1) |
                          |                    |
                    Y8_99j8 = -----------------------,
                              (n928 - n918 + 1)81/2

9which computes the standard deviation of the mean.
