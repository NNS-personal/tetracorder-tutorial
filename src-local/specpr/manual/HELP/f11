     This routine removes the thermal component from the reflectance  object
spectrum using the equation:

          |      R9o8'(1-R9s8)P9s8   P9o8| |    P9o8|8-1
9     R9o8 = |R9o8' + ----------- - --| |1 - --|                   (eqn 8.f11.1)

Region  of  Planetary  Thermal Emission, _I_c_a_r_u_s _4_0, 94-103 (equation 14) for
more information.

      R9o8  = Reflectance of object with thermal component removed.

      R9o8' = Reflectance of object with thermal component.

      R9s8  = Reflectance of standard with no thermal component.

      P9o8  = Temperature for Planck function of object (in Degrees Kelvin).

      P9s8  = Temperature for Planck function of standard (in Degrees Kelvin).

      F   = (solar flux/PI)/(distance from sun in A.U.)82

     The program requires that the file ID and record number of R9o8' and  the
e  to include errors, if any, be specified when called from Math operations.
The program will ask for:

      R9s8: The file ID and record number.

      The albedo at the normalization wavelength for R9o8 and R9s8 (0.0  <  A  <_
           1.0).  If the data are already in albedo (reflectance), then this
           constant should = 1.0 (the spectra are multiplied  by  this  con-
           stant).

      The wavelength data set (File ID and record number).

      P9o8 and P9s8 in degrees Kelvin (10 < T < 10859).

      Solar flux/PI data set (file ID and record number).

      Distance from sun in A.U. (>0.0)


     After entering albedo at normalization,  the  user  has  an  option  of
either  continuing, exiting, or changing what has been input so far (for the





current screen information).  User also has a similar option after  entering
distance  from the sun.  In calculating the thermal removal, R9o8 and R9s8 spec-
tra are multiplied by their respective albedos at the  normalization  point.
Errors  are  propagated  by  multiplying  individual  error values by the R9o
8albedo at the normalization point.
