     This section describes  the  steps  necessary  to  basically  configure
specpr  for  working with data.  This section describes the basic setup.  To
start with no setup, you must enter no arguments on the  command  line  (see
Chapter 3).


_5._2  _B_e_g_i_n_n_i_n_g

     As the program is started,  messages  relating  to  recent  changes  to
specpr  are printed.  These messages can be skipped with command line flags;
see Chapter 3 for details on how to start specpr from the operating  system.
However,  to  start specpr from scratch and do a basic setup, you can't skip
messages.

     When specpr starts with messages, the program is actually a  Unix  text
viewing  program  (usually it is configured to be the program "more", but it
could vary depending on your local specpr administrator).  Assuming you  are
in  the  Unix "more" program, if you wish to skip these messages type "q" to
quit, or type the space bar to see the next page of information.

     After specpr messages have been  printed,  specpr  asks  you  to  press
return  before  continuing.  As soon as you do, the SPECPR version date will
be  written on the screen.  Two options are available at this point:

     Type

                    _u <_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e>

to create a new restart file or type

                    _r <_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e>

to use an existing restart file.

     A restart routine is used so that SPECPR may be exited and  later  res-
tarted  with the same files assigned and protection and other parameters the
same as the time of the exit.  The restart parameters are stored in  a  disc
file  and  are  updated  periodically, as new sections of specpr are entered
during normal operation.  See Chapter 3 for additional information  on  res-
tart and restart files.


_5._3  _P_r_o_t_e_c_t_i_o_n

     The next section for basic setup is the file protections.   Protections
are  set before files are assigned, so that the protections will be in place
when the files get assigned in a following step.  Some users think  this  is
backwards,  but  it  is  just  another  safety  precaution.   When assigning
protections to each file ID, anticipate which files will be assigned in  the
file  assignments  section  so  that  they will be correct.  Plan your basic
setup.

     Specpr protection is designed to protect your data.  Proper use is very
important,  because if your data are not protected, it takes only one little
typing mistake to destroy something important!  In specpr, all files may  be
totally  or partially protected, or completely unprotected.  The fourth line
of the CRT header gives the protection status for all six  devices  (devices
v, w, d, u, v, and s).

   o+ If the  protection  number  is  positive  or  zero,  the  device  is  a
     read/write  device  where  you can read up to and including the protec-
     tion, but you can only write to the protection +1 record.  For example,
     a  value  of  637 means you can read the first 637 records, and you can
     only write to record 638.

   o+ A protection number of -1 means totally unprotected so you may read  or
     write anywhere in the file randomly.

   o+ A protection number of less than -1 means the  device  is  a  read-only
     device  where  you can read up to the absolute value protection number.
     For example, a value of -264 means 264 records are read  only  and  you
     can't write to the file.

You can set the protections on many files on one command line.  Example:

          _v_0 _d-_1 _u_4_3_2 _y-_6_0_0 _w-_6_0_0 _s-_5_0

where v0 means to protect 0 files on device v (write to file 1 only, 0 files
can  be read); u432 means to protect up to record 432 (write to record 433);
y-600 means that y is a read-only device with 600 records; similarly for  w;
and s is a read-only file with 50 records.  If the protection number is zero
or positive, it is incremented each time the device is written to.  See sec-
tion 2.3 for more details on file protection.

     The observatory location is used by  specpr  to  compute  air  mass  in
astronomical data reductions, or for example, terrestrial field observations
if the position of the sun were important.  If you are not doing  astronomi-
cal  extinction  corrections, this is not applicable and the not applicable,
"na" flag should be set.  The request for observatory location looks like:

   v = *unasnd*: f    1    w = *unasnd*: f    1    d = *unasnd*: f    1
   u = *unasnd*: f    1    y = *unasnd*: f    1    s = starpack: f    1
   lp: spoolfile       obs lat=    .000 deg   channels= 256 wav fl=C  256 h
   file protection: v     0,w     0,d     0,u     0,y     0,s     0 ltype= 0
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    type in observatory or location: type  mko  for mauna kea observatory
                                     type  na   for not applicable
                                     type  wal  for wallace observatory
                                     type  mwo  for mount wilson observatory
                                     type  kpn  for kitt peak national obs.
            type  t  to type in the coordinates of the observing site.

Three-letter codes are shown for often  used  observatories.   If  you  wish
another observatory location, type

                    _t

and then the program will request the latitude in degrees, minutes, seconds,
free format.  Longitude is not needed because the sidereal time is contained
with each spectrum.  The observatory location is used only in computing  the
air mass in the object-sky subtraction routine.

     The device and file assignments menu with a new start looks like:

   v = *unasnd*: f    1    w = *unasnd*: f    1    d = *unasnd*: f    1
   u = *unasnd*: f    1    y = *unasnd*: f    1    s = starpack: f    1
   lp: spoolfile       obs lat=    .000 deg   channels= 256 wav fl=C  256 h
   file protection: v     0,w     0,d     0,u     0,y     0,s     0 ltype= 0
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 *** FILE ASSIGNMENTS ***
                 -----------------------------------
   to reassign files type letter and name:
      (74 characters max per file name)
   v = /dev/null
   w = /dev/null
   d = /dev/null
   s = /dev/null
   u = /dev/null
   y = /dev/null
   l = spoolfile
       e  or  x = EXIT this routine

To assign a file you type in the file ID letter followed by the  file  name.
But there can be qualifiers, and Chapter 6 is devoted to the details of file
assignments.

     The listing device can be a file or the line printer spooler.  To  have
the  listing  device assigned to the line printer spooler, specify a name of
"spoolfile" for ID l as shown in the above  menu.   Specpr  will  write  all
lists  to a file in the current directory, and when the list is complete, it
will send the file to the spooler and truncate file length to zero length in
preparation for the next listing.

     The next step in basic setup is to assign the names to  each  file  ID.
The  names  entered  here  are  VERY  IMPORTANT for the history mechanism of
specpr.  The names entered here should reflect the archive  name  where  the
data  will  ultimately  be stored.  Traditionally, these names have been the
names of the mag tapes from which the data comes or  to  which  it  will  be
written.   The  names  are  a  maximum of 8 characters.  You must be certain
these names are correct if you  want  the  histories  to  be  correct.   See

     There are several graphics options available  in  this  program.   They
were  implemented  to  allow  specpr to be run from different terminals, for
example HP2623A, HP2648A, non-graphics  terminals.   Please  note  that  the
graphics  option does not show up at the beginning of a new restart, but has
to be set from the Initialize Parameter Routine via Program Operations.   To
change the terminal configuration, go to program operations control and type
"g#" where # is a number from the table below.  If you type g and  a  return
with  no  number,  it  is equivalent to typing g4.  Options not in the table
default to HP graphics.  These are the options available:

        g2   HP2393A compatible graphics, Set White on Black mode
        g3   HP2393A compatible graphics, Compliment, White on Black mode
        g4   HP2393A compatible graphics, Jam mode, white on black (DEFAULT)
        g11  HP2393A compatible graphics, Set Black on White mode
        g13  HP2393A compatible graphics, Compliment, Black on White mode

        g20  Tektronix Plot 10 compatible graphics terminals
        g21  DEC VT240 with (sort of) Tektronix Plot 10 graphics
        g22  GTERM (Tektronix window in a Sun gterm window)

        g50  X-Windows using an hpterm window (see X-NOTE below)
        g51  X-Windows using an xterm window (see X-NOTE below)

        g99  Scrolling mode (non-graphics terminal)
        g100 Televideo 914 alphanumeric terminal with no graphics

X-Windows NOTES:

o+  When running X-windows, the environment variable DISPLAY must
   be set to your X server.

o+ Every time you enter specpr, you must re-initialize the graphics
   window by typing g50 or g51 or by specifying the graphics mode on the
   command line as specified in section 3.1.

o+ User input always comes from the text window except for mouse
   button clicks which are entered in the graphics window.

o+ If the graphics window is hidden and then exposed, it will not be
   redrawn.

     The basic setup menu (type b from the main menu) includes a command  to
evaluate  current protections compared to what protections might be based on
file sizes.  This is done by the "f" command.  The f  command  computes  the
number  of records in the file from the file size and assumes the protection
should be all records in the file.  If the protection does  not  agree  with

the  computed  value,  a  warning  message  is printed and you are given the
option to change the protection to the computed  value.   Further,  you  are
given  the  option  to make the file read only.  You should use this command
any time you are not sure of the proper file protection.
