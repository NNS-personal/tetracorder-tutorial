     The Program Operations Control is the main menu  part  of  the  program
which  allows  access  to  math  operations,  file  list, overlay, transfer,
display, plot, file assignments, initialization and other applications  pro-
grams  such  as  the extinction routines.  This is also the only point where
the program should be terminated.  The main menu looks like:

  __________________________________________________________________________
   v = spdemos : f    1    w = *unasnd*: f    1    d = *unasnd*: f    1
   u = *unasnd*: f    1    y = *unasnd*: f    1    s = starpack: f    1
   lp: spoolfile       obs lat=    .000 deg   channels= 256 wav fl=C  256 h
   file protection: v    53,w     0,d     0,u     0,y     0,s     0 ltype= 0

       To list the contents of the data files (v, w, d, u,  or  y),  type  l
  followed by the corresponding letter.  For example to list the contents of
  file v, type:

                    _l_v

See Chapter 11 for instructions once you are in the list routine.



  _7._4  _T_e_r_m_i_n_a_t_i_n_g _P_r_o_g_r_a_m

       To stop specr, type

                    _E_X

All files and devices will be closed  properly,  and  specpr  will  print  a
summary  of  the  files  assigned  and  their protections.  When you restart
specpr, the files will be opened and protections set to the  same  state  as
when you quit at this point.



  _7._5  _F_i_l_e _D_i_s_p_l_a_y, _T_r_a_n_s_f_e_r, _a_n_d _O_v_e_r_l_a_p

       To transfer (copy) files, or display or overlap data on the CRT, type

                    _t

See Chapter 10 for information once you are in  the  display,  transfer  and
overlap routines.

       To change the basic setup parameters or reassign files  and  devices,
  type

                    _b

  The basic setup parameter menu is then displayed:

  __________________________________________________________________________
   v = spdemos : f   25    w =         : f    1    d = *unasnd*: f    1
   u = *unasnd*: f    1    y = *unasnd*: f    1    s = starpack: f    1

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      *** SETUP parameters ***


       type  o    to change the OBSERVATORY or observatory site
       type  r    to REASSIGN FILES and devices
       type  f    to EVALUATE PROTECTION vs file sizes
                  (no response indicates all is consistent)
       type  g    and number to set GRAPHICS type (see manual)
       type  b    to toggle BELL
       type  v    to change the NAME of device v
       type  d    to change the NAME of device d
       type  u    to change the NAME of device u
       type  y    to change the NAME of device y
       type  w    to change the NAME of device w
       type  cp   to change the  FILE PROTECTION

       press return to go back to the MAIN routines.
  __________________________________________________________________________

  See Chapter 5 for details on each command.

  From the main menu, it is possible to enter  a  multiple  command  and  go
  right  to  the  basic  setup  section  desired.   From the main menu, type
  b<basic setup command>.  For example to change protection  from  the  main
  menu, type:

                    _b_c_p



  _7._7  _D_e_v_i_c_e _a_n_d _F_i_l_e _A_s_s_i_g_n_m_e_n_t_s

       To go to Device and File Assignments, type

                    _r

See Chapter 6 for details on the assignment routines.
