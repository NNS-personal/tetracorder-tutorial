     Special Function 19 does a least squares fit to a data set with a poly-
nomial of the form:

               y = a918 + a928 x + a938 x839 + a948 x829 + ... + a9n8 x8n-1

9The program requests the number of terms to use for the polynomial  fit  and
will  currently handle up to ten terms. To run this routine type the file id
and record number of the spectrum you wish to fit followed by  f19,  or  use
the alias:

              _v_2_3_f_1_9
or
              _v_1_3_p_o_l_y

The program will allow you to change the wavelength set if the  current  set
is  not  the proper one. The program then calculates the least squares curve
and prints the polynomial coefficients and the reduced chi  square  for  the
fit.

     You have the option of saving  the  fitted  curve,  computed  with  the
wavelength  set in use, or saving the coefficients.  The coefficients can be
used as input to f21 (calculate a polynomial).
