     To run specpr you must first log in to the system.  It is advisable  to
do  specpr  work  for  a particular project in a separate directory.  Specpr
uses protective locks on files to prevent simultaneous specpr sessions  from
overwriting  data.  Thus, if you are starting a new project, create a direc-
tory in which to start, then cd to that directory.


     You can start specpr in one of five ways, using the following commands.


          specpr              starts specpr, first  with  current  messages,
                              then  a  start "from scratch" where a complete
                              setup is required.  After  the  word  "specpr"
                              type a carriage return.


          specpr rfile        starts specpr in restart mode, where the  res-
                              tart file "rfile" contains all the information
                              saved  from  the  previous  session.    Before
                              specpr   is   started,  current  messages  are
                              displayed.


          specpr rfile -gN    starts  specpr  in  restart  mode,  where  the
                              restart   file   "rfile"   contains   all  the
                              information saved from the  previous  session.
                              The  -gN  option,  where  N  is  the  graphics
                              terminal type integer number given in  section
                              5.7,  sets  the  graphics  type  as  specpr is
                              started.  The "N"  may  also  be  one  of  the
                              strings   "xterm"  or  "hpterm"  (without  the
                              quotes.   Thus  the  command   "specpr   rfile
                              -gxterm"   starts  specpr  with  restart  file
                              "rfile" and starts an xterm X-windows graphics
                              session.


          specpr rfile -      starts  specpr  in  restart  mode,  where  the
                              restart   file   "rfile"   contains   all  the
                              information saved from the  previous  session.
                              The  minus sign suppresses messages unless new
                              messages have been added since the  last  time
                              "rfile"  has  been  written.   After  a  basic
                              setup, this is the command you  will  want  to
                              use to restart specpr (or the command below).

          specpr rfile -gN -  starts  specpr  in  restart  mode,  where  the
                              restart   file   "rfile"   contains   all  the
                              information saved from the  previous  session.
                              The  -gN  option,  where  N  is  the  graphics
                              terminal type integer number given in  section
                              5.7,  sets  the  graphics  type  as  specpr is
                              started.  The "N"  may  also  be  one  of  the
                              strings   "xterm"  or  "hpterm"  (without  the
                              quotes.  The minus  sign  suppresses  messages
                              unless  new messages have been added since the
                              last timer "rfile" has been written.  After  a
                              basic setup, this is the command you will want
                              to use  to  restart  specpr  (especially  when
                              starting  specpr  from  X-windows).   Thus the
                              command "specpr rfile -gxterm -" starts specpr
                              with  restart file "rfile" and starts an xterm
                              X-windows graphics session.



     The restart file contains all information  for  restarting  specpr  and
putting  it  in  the  same  state as when you last quit the program.  Specpr
periodically updates the restart file during a processing session in case of
a system or program crash.

     The specpr startup messages are notes and  information  about  changes,
additions and bugs in the current version of specpr.

     The user may get help at any keyboard input point in the  program.   To
get help, you simply type

              _h_e_l_p
or
              _h_e_l_p <_k_e_y_w_o_r_d>

where "<keyword>" is a key word to search on.  The index of key words and  a
description is displayed by just typing help.

     Once in help, help is  read  with  the  Unix  command  defined  by  the
environment  variable  PAGER  (see section 3.3), or if PAGER is not defined,
the Unix "more" command is used.  When reading help, if there is  more  than
one  page you must follow the directions for that Unix command (e.g. for the
more command, press the space bar to get to the next page or a  "q"  command
to  quit).   When  you  have  completed  reading the index page or a keyword
entry, the following message is displayed:

        ----------------------------------------- PRESS RETURN  TO  CONTINUE
        with  program,  Type a keyword for help on that topic, or Type  help
        for the index page -----------------------------------------

If you want to read about another keyword, simply type  that  key  word  and
press  return.   If  you  want  to  redisplay  the  index pages, type "help"
(without the quotes) as the key word.

Example:  to get help on file protection at any point in specpr, type

              _h_e_l_p _p_r_o_t_e_c_t_i_o_n

or, type

              _h_e_l_p

and once in the help facility, type the

              _p_r_o_t_e_c_t_i_o_n

key word.

     Specpr currently recognizes two environment variables.  An  environment
variable is a variable that is set from the Unix command line.  For example,
in the c-shell, you type

              setenv PAGER myprog

to set the environment variable PAGER.  See your local system  documentation
on setting environment variables for other Unix shells.

     Commonly, users define these variables in the login startup  files,  so
they get activated each time the user logs in.

     The environment variables currently used and defined by specpr are:

    PAGER  The program used for listing to the terminal  screen.   Currently
            it  is  used  by the help facility.  Default program if PAGER is
            not defined is the Unix "more" command.

    EDITOR  The editor to use.  Currently, this is the editor  to  use  when
            editing  specpr  text  records  in the header information change
            routines.  Default editor is "vi".
