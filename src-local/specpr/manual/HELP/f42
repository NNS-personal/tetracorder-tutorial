     This routine fits an absorption band from a reference  spectrum  to  an
observed spectrum by minimizing the least squares.  The reference absorption
band depth is changed by a simple  equation  (thus  the  reference  spectrum
chosen should have an absorption band profile similar in saturation level to
the observed spectrum in order to provide the best fit).

     This routine is described in detail in the paper

     To use f42, the user types the observed spectrum and f42 from the  math
command line.  For example, if v76 is the observed spectrum, you would type:

              _v_7_6_f_4_2

Next you will be prompted to enter the reference library  spectrum  file  ID
and record number.

Then you are asked to enter the left and right continuum values.   The  con-
tinuum is located on each side of the absorption band and consists of one or
more data channels.  You enter the beginning and ending  channels  for  each
side.   For example, if the channels describing the left side of the contin-
uum included channels 331, 332, and 333 and  if  the  right  side  continuum
included channels 385, 386, 387, and 388, you would enter the following.

              _3_3_1 _3_3_3 _3_8_5 _3_8_8

If the continuum included only one channel, you still must enter 4  numbers,
so  the  beginning and ending channel would be the same.  For example if the
continuum was only channel 331 on the left and 339 and 340 on the right, you
would type:

              _3_3_1 _3_3_1 _3_3_9 _3_4_0


     Next you are asked what data to output to the file.  You can  save  the
fitted  reference  spectrum  (press  return,  this  is  the default), or the
continuum-removed observed spectrum  by  typing  "o"  (you  don't  type  the
quotes).

     The absorption band depth, D, is defined relative to its continuum:

          D = 1 - R9b8/R9c8                                         (eqn 8.f42.1)





where R9c8 is the reflectance of the continuum at the band center, and  R9b8  is
the  reflectance  at  the band center.  The definition originates from Clark
and Roush, (JGR, 1984).  The process of absorption band analysis is to first
remove  a  continuum  (see Clark and Roush, 1984 for details about continuum
analysis).  Once the continuum is removed, a band can  be  characterized  by
determining how well the feature matches a reference library spectrum.

     A simple model to change a continuum-removed absorption feature's  con-
trast  is  to  add a constant to the data at all wavelengths.  In this case,
the feature will not be represented properly if the band saturation  changed
significantly, due to say a major change in grain size between the reference
and observed spectra.  The algorithm presented here uses the simple case  of
an  additive component because it is computationally fast compared to a full
radiative transfer model.  The method can easily  be  adapted  to  the  full
model  however, or even to a method that examines the band depth and chooses
an appropriately saturated absorption feature from a library of materials at
several grain sizes.

     The algorithm first removes a straight line continuum from the  library
reference  spectrum  using  channels  on each side of the absorption feature
that is to be mapped.  The continuum is removed from the  observed  spectrum
using  the  same  method and spectral channels.  The user may select several
channels on each side of the band so that noise in the  continuum  is  aver-
aged.  The continuum is removed by division:

              L(L)                       O(L)
      L9c8(L) = -----    and       O9c8(L) = -----,         (eqn 8.f42.2 a and b)
              C9l8(L)                      C9o8(L)

where L(L) is the library spectrum as a function of wavelength, L, O is  the
observed  spectrum,  C9l8 is the continuum for the library spectrum, C9o8 is the
continuum for the observed spectrum, L9c8 is  the  continuum  removed  library
spectrum, and O9c8 is the continuum removed observed spectrum.

     The contrast in the reference library spectrum  absorption  feature  is
modified by a simple additive constant, k:

                     L9c8 + k
               L9c8' = ------,                                    (eqn 8.f42.3)
                     1.0 +k

where L9c8' is the modified continuum-removed spectrum that best  matches  the
observed spectrum.  This equation can be rewritten in the form:

              L9c8' = a + bL9c8,                                    (eqn 8.f42.4)

where

              a =  k /(1.0 + k), and

              b = 1.0/(1.0 + k).                                (eqn 8.f42.5)


     In Equation 8.f42.4 we want to find the a and b that gives a  best  fit





to  the  observed  spectrum  O9c8.   The solution is done using standard least
squares:

              a = (R O9c8 - bR L9c8)/n,

                  R O9c8L9c8 - R O9c8R L9c8/n
              b = -------------------,
                  R L9c729 - (R L9c8)829/n

and
              k = (1-b)/b,                                      (eqn 8.f42.6)

where n is the number of spectral channels in the fit.

     The algorithm produces a band depth, indicating its spectral  abundance
in  the  observed  image,  a goodness of fit (correlation coefficient) which
gives a measure of confidence in the accuracy of the resulting fit, and  the
continuum  value  at the band center in the observed spectrum.  The correla-
tion coefficient is computed by

              r = sqrt(b918b'918)                             (eqn 8.f42.7)

where b918 is from Bevington (Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physi-
cal Sciences, Mcgraw Hill, New York, 1969), his equation 7.2 (which he calls
b) on page 120, and b'918 is from Bevington (1969), his equation 7.3 (which he
calls b') on page 121.
