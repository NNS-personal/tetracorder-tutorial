     This routine uses the system random number generator to generate  noise
with  a  normal  distribution and a standard deviation of 1.0.  The user can
then multiply the resulting numbers by a constant to generate noise  with  a
different standard deviation, and the noise may be added to a spectrum.

     The routine generates a random number for each  channel  in  use.   The
user  then  gives a scale factor to scale the noise to the desired interval.
For example if you wanted noise of 3%  (standard  deviation  of  0.03),  you
would scale the noise by 0.03.
