     This function allows editing of a data set and, if e  is  specified  at
call time, its associated error set as well.


     To call f14, specify the file and record number, f14,  and,  if  errors
are desired, e.

Example:

        _v_3_1_7_f_1_4_e                    _o_r               _v_3_1_7_f_1_4


     F14 accepts the following  formatted  commands  to  perform  particular
tasks:

        channel data/e error                            change
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        d[c] channel [channel1 t channel2] c          delete
        i channel                                     insert after
        l channel1 channel2                           list (crt)
        pd                                            print data (lp)
        c                                             continue
                                                       (exit with write)
        e                                             soft exit
        x                                             hard exit
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Note: both e and x terminate the editing session without
              writing the results.  Use "c" to exit and write results.


     To CHANGE a data value (and its error, or just its error), specify  the
channel  number  of  the value to be changed and the new data value (and the
new error value); should you wish to change  only  the  error,  specify  the
channel  number, e, and the new error value. (If you wish to change only the
data value but you specified e at call time, you must specify three  parame-
ters;  the  channel  number,  the  new data value, and the old error value.)
Incorrect or uninterpretable format  will  cause  an  error  message  to  be
printed  on  the  terminal  screen.   (Parameters  may  be entered either as
integers or as real numbers but not in exponential format.)

Examples:

        Call setup  Command        Task enacted

        v317f14    11 13.567    change channel 11 data value to 13.567
        v317f14e   11 13.4 .2   change ch. 11 data to 13.4, error to .2
        v317f14e   11 e .2      change ch. 11 error value to .2
        v317f14e   11 13.567    ILLEGAL ENTRY (errors were specified at
                                call time, but no error value was entered)





     To DELETE data values, specify d (or "dc" to delete and compress);  the
routine  will  then  accept  only channel number or channel ranges until the
parameter c (do not confuse the parameter c with the option  c)  is  encoun-
tered,  at  which  time the delete task is performed.  Without option c, the
data values of all specified channels will be set to -1.23e+34 (the standard
value  for  SPECPR deleted points) [and the associated errors will be set to
0.0].  However, if the dc command is specified, the  specified  points  will
first  be  deleted, and then the channel space will be compressed to totally
eliminate the specified channels.  (Note:  Compression of the channel  space
does  not  take  effect until all specified points have first been deleted.)
Channel numbers for the points to be deleted may be specified either indivi-
dually or as ranges; the character t specifies a range of channels, starting
with (and including) the number preceding t, and ending with (and including)
the  number following t, the command d, [the option c,] individual channels,
channel ranges, and the parameter c may all be strung together;  spaces  are
required as delimiters only between two numbers.

Examples:

        Command                             Task enacted

        d6 7 12t13 18t21c               Data values for channels 6, 7, 12,
                                        13, 18, 19, 20, 21 are set to
                                        -1.23e34:[errors for same channels
                                        are set to 0.0]

        dc1t3 7c                        channels 1, 2, 3, 7 are deleted
                                        totally; old ch. 4 becomes new ch.
                                        1; old ch. 5 becomes new 2; old 8
                                        becomes new 4.

        dc                              routine requests "enter more
                                        deletions or type c to continue"


     To INSERT data [and error] values after a specified channel, specify  i
and  the channel number after which you wish to insert values.  (If no chan-
nel is specified, the routine defaults to  channel  0,  in  which  case  the
insertions  occur at the start of a spectrum.)  The routine will then accept
only data [and error] values, one data [and error]  value  per  line,  until
either a blank line or two carriage returns in a row are encountered; either
integers or real numbers (but not exponential  format)  are  acceptable  for
data and errors.

Example:














        Call setup    Command sequence         Task enacted

        v317f14e         i                routine prepares to accept data
                                          & errors, starting at channel 1

                         12 1.3           new channel 1: data = 12;
                                          error = 1.3; original ch. 1
                                          becomes new channel 2

                                          error = .9; original ch.1
                                          becomes new channel 3

                         i2               routine prepares to accept data
                                          & errors starting after current
                                          channel 2

                        17.9              ILLEGAL ENTRY--no error was
                                          specified; routine requests last
                                          line to be retyped

                        17.9 1.6          new channel 4: data = 17.9;
                                          error = 1.6; original ch.1 is
                                          now ch.5

                       <return>           insertion routine stops
        -----------------------------------------------------------------


     To LIST data and error values on the terminal  screen,  specify  l  and
either  a  channel  number  or  else  two  channel limits.  Data [and error]
values will be listed in exponential  format  along  with  channel  numbers.
(Spaces  are required as delimiters between limits.)  All data values within
the channel limits are listed first; error values follow.

Example:

        l 1 60    channel number & data value for channels 1 through
                  60 are listed on the terminal [followed by channel
                  number & error value for channels 1 through 60]

        l 5       5 and data value for ch. 5 [and 5 and error value for
                  ch. 5] are listed on the terminal


     To PRINT the data [and error] values on the line printer,  specify  pd.
The  output  format is the same as when pd is specified in the CRT plot rou-
tine.

     To CONTINUE normally and write the edited file, specify the command  c;
the  routine  will  exit  to  the  write-to-file routine.  Note:  You cannot





return to f14 and issue additional commands once CONTINUE is enacted.)

     A SOFT or HARD EXIT will occur if at any time  the  commands  e  or  x,
respectively,  are  encountered;  control  will  return  to MATH OPERATIONS.
(Exception:  In CHANGE, e is not interpreted as an EXIT command if  it  fol-
lows a channel specification.)

     _I_M_P_O_R_T_A_N_T _N_O_T_E: This routine does NOT record a history of the edit com-
mands  performed;  should  you desire a record of your editing commands, you
must create a manual history  yourself.   However,  edited  changes  can  be
easily  seen  by  comparing with the original data set which is specified in
the history.


Minor notes:

     All channel numbers should be positive integers; if a  real  number  is
entered by mistake, the routine will truncate it to integer form.  All chan-
nel range limits must list the lower bound first and the upper bound last.

     If at any time during this routine you find yourself lost or  confused,
try  pressing  <return>  once or twice until the EDIT COMMAND FORMAT message
appears.  Alternatively, you may type e or x to exit f14.

     You may insert spaces as delimiters to improve the clarity of commands;
use of such spaces will not affect the operation of f14.
