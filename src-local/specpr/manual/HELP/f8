     This routine transposes the array of channel (column)  versus  spectrum
(rows)  to spectrum versus channel.  For example, if you had 10 spectra of 5
channels each where each spectrum was taken at 1 hour intervals,  this  rou-
tine  transposes the matrix so that there are 5 output "spectra" of 10 chan-
nels each where each "spectrum" is intensity at 10 different times.

Example: given 4 spectra of 3 channels each:

              Spectrum |    Channel number
              Number   |  1       2       3
                       |---------------------
                   1   | 1.23   1.34    1.45
                   2   | 2.23   2.34    2.45
                   3   | 3.23   3.34    3.45
                   4   | 4.23   4.34    4.45

would be transposed to:

              Spectrum |    Channel number
              Number   |  1       2       3       4
                       |-----------------------------
                   1   | 1.23   2.23    3.23    4.23
                   2   | 1.34   2.34    3.34    4.34
                   3   | 1.45   2.45    3.45    4.45


     _W_A_R_N_I_N_G: When you first enter the  transpose  routine,  it  prints  the
wavelength  set  in use.  The wavelength set controls the number of channels
(and thus the potential number of output spectra), so it must be set to  the
right value.

     The first input request is an option to delete channels.  If you delete
input  channels,  the  output  spectrum will have that channel deleted.  You
delete channels by typing "d" and the channels to be deleted (see plot  rou-
tines  for  a more complete description of the delete points routine), and a
"c" to continue to the next step.  For example, say you had  20  spectra  of
100 channels each, taken as a function of time and you wanted to only have a
data set that was the intensity of channel 33.  You  would  delete  all  but
channel 33:

              _d _1_t_3_2 _3_4_t_1_0_0 _c

(you may include spaces anywhere except within a number).

     Next, you will be requested to enter each (non-deleted) channel.  Input
spectra  are  entered one per line (file letter ID and record number).  When
all are typed in, type

              _b





to begin transpose.

     The routine will next ask for the beginning output  location  (type  in
file letter ID and record number) and then a common title for all the output
spectra.  The transpose will then begin and the output spectra will be  out-
put  sequentially  beginning  at  the  beginning  point in the file that you
selected.

     The number of output spectra is equal to the number of channels in  use
minus the deleted channels.
