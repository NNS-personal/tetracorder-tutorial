F16:  Line Segment Data Generator                           Alias: line[gen]
This routine generates arrays of data by linearly interpolating user (x,y)
pairs to a wavelength set.
Given data values at specific wavelengths or channels typed in by
the user, this routine computes line segments between the points
the user has input.
Upon entering the routine, the user has the
option of changing the current wavelength set in use by typing
the file ID letter (upper case) and the record number, or assigning the channel
numbers as &quot;wavelength values&quot; with the maximum number of
channels given by the wavelength record.  To do this, type h and
the wavelength record number to assign channel numbers with the
number of channels given by the wavelength record number.  Examples:

        V23      Assign wavelength data set in v23.
        h482     Assign the array value = the wavelength data value.
                 (channel 1 = 1.0, channel 2 = 2.0, ... channel 482 = 482.0).
        C482     same as h482, but the wavelength routines assign the
                 wavelength set before it is handed to the f16 routine.
        &lt;return&gt; Use existing wavelength set in use.

<p>After this initialization, the routine repeatedly asks
for the first two data values--the (x,y) coordinates for
user point #1, then #2, etc., until you are through. Enter
the data values separated by a space. At each command point,
a number of control options can be entered:</p>

<p>e or x will cause the routine to exit.</p>

<p>rn return to step n, where n is the step number. This
allows the return to any previous input step so it may be
changed (and then you may return to the last step before you
went to step n). Note that you cannot change an x value
(wavelength) to a value greater than that in the next
step--to do that, you must delete the following steps.</p>

<p>dn delete steps. Using this command, all data values
after and including step n will be deleted; command control
returns to the first step deleted.</p>

<p>ln is a list command which will list up to 25 entries
previously entered with the step number. Here (n) is
optional. If it is used, the routine lists from step number
n to step n+24.</p>

<p>b for begin analysis. The routine calculates all data
values in the array between each set of ordered pairs.</p>

<p>No input spectrum is required because you are creating
data, not operating on data. If an input file was called, an
error message is printed, and the routine will hard exit.
All operations are checked for validity. If a given
operation produces an error, a message will be printed
stating what caused the error and whether or not the routine
can continue. If it can, the routine asks again for the
data. If not, the routine will exit, hard or soft, depending
on the severity of the condition. Note that all x data
values (e.g. wavelengths) must be in increasing order, or
error messages will result.</p>
