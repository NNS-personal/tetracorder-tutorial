F46:  Band Analysis Output                              Alias = abaout
This routine reads specpr data records produced from the Automated
Band Analysis routine, f45, and outputs the data to a binary file in
order to generate a spectral features data base.  The independent
program &quot;spfeatures&quot; reads the data base created by this routine.
In addition to the features, this routine adds the title and
spectral identification (specpr file name and record number) to the
features binary data base.
