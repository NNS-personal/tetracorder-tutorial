<p align=center>STARTING SPECPR</p>

<p>3.1 Starting Specpr on Unix To run specpr you must first
log in to the system. It is advisable to do specpr work for
a particular project in a separate directory. Specpr uses
protective locks on files to prevent simultaneous specpr
sessions from overwriting data. Thus, if you are starting a
new project, create a directory in which to start, then cd
to that directory.</p>

<p>You can start specpr in one of five ways, using the
following commands.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="81%">
<p>starts specpr, first with current messages, then a start
&quot;from scratch&quot; where a complete setup is required.
After the word &quot;specpr&quot; type a carriage
return.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>starts specpr in restart mode, where the restart file
&quot;rfile&quot; contains all the information saved from
the previous session. Before specpr is started, current
messages are displayed.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>starts specpr in restart mode, where the restart file
&quot;rfile&quot; contains all the information saved from
the previous session. The -gN option, where N is the
graphics terminal type integer number given in section 5.7,
sets the graphics type as specpr is started. The
&quot;N&quot; may also be one of the strings
&quot;xterm&quot; or &quot;hpterm&quot; (without the quotes.
Thus the command &quot;specpr rfile -gxterm&quot; starts
specpr with restart file &quot;rfile&quot; and starts an
xterm X-windows graphics session.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>starts specpr in restart mode, where the restart file
&quot;rfile&quot; contains all the information saved from
the previous session. The minus sign suppresses messages
unless new messages have been added since the last time
&quot;rfile&quot; has been written. After a basic setup,
this is the command you will want to use to restart specpr
(or the command below).</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->

&quot;N&quot; may also be one of the strings

The minus sign suppresses messages unless new messages have
been added since the last timer &quot;rfile&quot; has been
written. After a basic setup, this is the command you will
want to use to restart specpr (especially when starting
specpr from X-windows). Thus the command &quot;specpr rfile
-gxterm -&quot; starts specpr with restart file
&quot;rfile&quot; and starts an xterm X-windows graphics
session.</p>

<p>The restart file contains all information for restarting
specpr and putting it in the same state as when you last
quit the program. Specpr periodically updates the restart
file during a processing session in case of a system or
program crash. The specpr startup messages are notes and
information about changes, additions and bugs in the current
version of specpr.</p>

<p>3.2 HELP! The user may get help at any keyboard input
point in the program. To get help, you simply type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>help</p></td>
</table>

<p>or</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>help &lt;keyword&gt;</p></td>
</table>

<p>where &quot;&lt;keyword&gt;&quot; is a key word to
search on. The index of key words and a description is
displayed by just typing help. Once in help, help is read
with the Unix command defined by the environment variable
PAGER (see section 3.3), or if PAGER is not defined, the
Unix &quot;more&quot; command is used. When reading help, if
there is more than one page you must follow the directions
for that Unix command (e.g. for the more command, press the
space bar to get to the next page or a &quot;q&quot; command
to quit). When you have completed reading the index page or
a keyword entry, the following message is displayed:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="15%"></td>
<td width="84%">
<p>----------------------------------------- PRESS RETURN TO
CONTINUE with program, Type a keyword for help on that
topic, or Type help for the index page
-----------------------------------------</p></td>
</table>

<p>If you want to read about another keyword, simply type
that key word and press return. If you want to redisplay the
index pages, type &quot;help&quot; (without the quotes) as
the key word.</p>

<p>Example: to get help on file protection at any point in
specpr, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>help protection</p></td>
</table>

<p>or, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>help</p></td>
</table>

<p>and once in the help facility, type the</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>protection</p></td>
</table>

<p>key word.</p>

<p>3.3 Configuration of Environment Variables Specpr
currently recognizes two environment variables. An
environment variable is a variable that is set from the Unix
command line. For example, in the c-shell, you type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>setenv PAGER myprog</p></td>
</table>

<p>to set the environment variable PAGER. See your local
system documentation on setting environment variables for
other Unix shells. Commonly, users define these variables in
the login startup files, so they get activated each time the
user logs in. The environment variables currently used and
defined by specpr are:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="92%">
<p>PAGER The program used for listing to the terminal
screen. Currently it is used by the help facility. Default
program if PAGER is not defined is the Unix &quot;more&quot;
command.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>EDITOR The editor to use. Currently, this is the editor
to use when editing specpr text records in the header
information change routines. Default editor is
&quot;vi&quot;.</p>
