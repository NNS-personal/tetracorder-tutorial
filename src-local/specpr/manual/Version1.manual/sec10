.sh 1 "FILE DISPLAY, TRANSFER, AND OVERLAY " 10


.sh 2 "File Display "
.pp
A spectrum can be displayed on the CRT using the CRT plot
routines (section 9) by typing in the file ID (V, W, D, U, or Y),
the file number, and any options.  Options are E for errors, A for
auto scale, B for auto scale with lineprinter plot, A followed by
a number 1 to 20 for wavelength file 1 to 20 (plot in wavelength
space).  If many files in sequence are to be plotted, then
directly after the file number type + and the number of files to
be plotted.  Thus, to plot spectra from device V, files 10 to 22,
type V10+12.  The +12 means the next 12 files after the requested
file should also be processed.  Note that the + specification will
yield strange results with option E (include errors) since the
file increment is always 1.  Thus, after plotting data with errors
(e.g. file V10 = data and file V11 = errors), the file increment
will be one, and the errors will be plotted as data with the next
file plotted as the errors to the errors!  To plot many spectra
in sequence which all have error files, they must be typed in
sequentially such as V10E V12E V14E V16E V18E V20E V22E.  Note no
spaces are required, but they can be inserted if desired.  No
commas are necessary (this is different from Math Operations).


.sh 3 "File Transfer "
.pp
Files can be transferred by specifying the file ID, file number,
the transfer specification
.ul
T,
and the file ID and file number of where the transfer is to go.
Many files may be transferred sequentially by using the plus
specification.  For example, V10TD23 transfers Vfile 10 to Dfile
23.  Also, V10 + 99TD23 transfers Vfile 10 plus the next 99
files to Dfile 23 plus the 99 files respectively.  Thus, Vfile
109 will be the last file transferred and will go to Dfile 99 +
23 = 122.


.sh 3 "File Tranfer with Plot or Information Change "
.pp
Files which are going to be transferred can be plotted (and thus
deglitched or information changed, see section 9) before the
transfer by the option
.ul
C.
The letter C stands for CRT plot routine.  Thus, to transfer V10
to D23 plus the next 5 files and display them before
transferring, type:
.ul
V10 + 5 CT D23.
If information only needs to be changed, the CRT plot can be
skipped and the information change routine called by a CIT
specification as in
.ul
V10 + 5 CIT D23.
The C is required since the information change routine is part of
the CRT plot routines.  The
.ul
I
then signals the CRT plot routines that the informtiaon change
routine only is requested.  Note, when transferring data to a
protected (positive or zero protection value) file, the file
number to transfer to must be 1 plus the protection value.  A file
number must be given so, if you say to transfer to V1 but 100
files are protected, the program will say there is a protection
violation.
.pp
Starpack transfers involve 3 regular data files.  Thus, to
transfer starpack 1 (S1) to V10 (S1TV10) will result in the
starpack being put into V10, V11, and V12.  When the starpack is
transferred back, the program automatically collects the 3 files
for starpack S1.  Thus, to transfer 6 starpacks (1 - 6) to Vfile
29+, type S1 + 5T V29.  The starpack will be put in savefiles 29
through 46.  To transfer these starpacks back, type V29 +
5 T S1.  When the program sees that starpacks are being transferred, it
knows the +5 means 5 starpacks at 3 regular files per starpack.


.sh 2 "Overlaying Spectra "
.pp
Overlaying spectra on the CRT is an excellent way to compare
data for reproducability.  For example, before an extinction
analysis, you should overlay your spectra to look for
inconsistencies in the data.  You can then throw out obviously bad
data.  The overlay is an option used in file display (see section
10.1).  To overlay spectra, type the file ID, file number, and the
option letter O.  The O must be included in every spectrum to be
overlaid.  Errors can be included, and the overlay can be in
channel, wavelength, or energy space.
.pp
The space type (wavelength, energy, or channel) can be set as an
option on the first file to be overlaid.  Thus, the overlay
region for different types of spectra may be easily compared.
However, when in wavelength space, you should not be in the
auto-scale mode.  An example of this occurs when trying to overlay
the visible Photometer Data (25 channels from 0.35 to 1.1 \(*mm)
and "Wedge" Circular Variable Filter data (120 channels from 0.62
to 2.5 \(*mm).  The minimum and maximum wavelengths are different
for the two data sets; thus the CRT plot routine will scale the
data differently if the wavelengths are auto scaled.  To avoid this
problem, simply set the minimum and maximum wavelengths to accept
the range of your data sets.
.pp
Many spectra in sequence can be plotted and overlaid by using the
plus specification as in section 10.1.  The program tells you
when the last file in a sequence is overlaid on the CRT.  The
plus specification will give strange results when including
errors as noted in section 10.1.
.pp
An example of overlaying spectra is:
.ul
V10O V11EO V23 + 5O V51 O.
Note that the letter O is required on the last file to be
overlaid.  If it is not included, the screen will be erased, and
the spectrum will be displayed as in section 10.1 (see section
10.4).  To use different wavelength files, one might type
.ul
V101A3OV102EOV143EOV145EOV208+10A4O.
Note that the wavelength file stays the same until it is changed
again.


.sh 2 "Multiple Commands in File Display, Transfer and Overlay "
.pp
One entire line (80 characters) can be input for execution.
These commands can be mixed freely between file displays, file
transfers, or file overlays.  Spaces may be included anywhere on
the line, but none are necessary.  An example of multiple commands
is:
.ul
V1+3CTD1 W34+10 V23+14O V38EO V102+243TV236 V346+10CITD480.
First there is a display and transfer of 4 files, then 11 files
are displayed, then 16 files overlaid (the last with error
bars), next 244 files are transferred, then 11 are transferred
with information change first.
.pp
In any of these routines, type E will exit to the next command,
and typing X will exit back to File Display, Transfer and Overlay
(except in the information change, see section 9) without
execution of the remaining commands.
.bp


.sh 1 "FILE LIST "


.sh 2 "File List "
.pp
From the File Operations, type the device file ID (V, W, D, U, or
Y) to call the file list routines.  You will then be given a list
of options or the list.  The CRT list contains only the file
number, title, the number of revolutions, civil/Universal time,
sidereal time, date, and the airmass.  The options are for the
lineprinter list (make sure the lineprinter is assigned if you
want an LP list).  Pressing return will list only on the CRT.
.pp
Typing
.ul
P
will list on the lineprinter, and typing
.ul
A
will do an "automatic" list on the lineprinter.  The difference
between the P and A specification is that, with the P
specification, the program halts after every 25 lines and asks
the user to type
.ul
C
to continue,
.ul
X
to exit,
.ul
T
to go to file Transfer or type in new file limits to
list (see below) or a new P or A specification.  With the A specification, the
screen is erased when the screen is full, and the list continues
until the limit is reached or an I/O error occurs.  If this limit
is reached and the user typed C to continue, the A specification
changes to a P specification so that the program will not list
forever.  Typing
.ul
E
or
.ul
X
will exit the routine.  Typing an option character after the P or
A specification (on the same line) will change what is printed on
the lineprinter.  No option prints the file number, title,
revolutions, integration time, civil/Universal time, sidereal
time, date, airmass, and the normalization factor on one line ad
the history just below the title.  For the case of average or
summation in the history, the manual history is also printed since
this contains an extension of the history.  Option
.ul
B
prints all header information except the manual history and the
data.  Option
.ul
C
prints all the header information but not the data.  Option
.ul
D
prints all the header information and the data.
.pp
After this, you will be asked to type in the beginning and ending
files to be listed.  Typing
.ul
E
or
.ul
X
will exit the routine.  If the second number is less than or
equal to zero, the routine will exit as with typing E or X.  If
the first file number is less than or equal to zero, it is set to
1.
.pp
When the program halts for input, you may type
.ul
C
to continue,
.ul
X
to exit,
.ul
T
to go to File Display, Transfer, and Overlay.  You may also type
in new limits (beginning and ending file numbers) to list, or you
may type the
.ul
P
or
.ul
A
specification with options
.ul
B,
.ul
C,
or
.ul
D
to change the type of list depending on the file number.  If you
type
.ul
P
or
.ul
A,
you will be asked to type in new file limits.  The line printer
may also be turned off (no list on lineprinter) by typing
.ul
N.
You will then be instructed to type in new file limits again.
.pp
Thus, when listing an entire data file, you may change the
information printed to save time and paper and suppress
information which will never be looked at or is not needed.
