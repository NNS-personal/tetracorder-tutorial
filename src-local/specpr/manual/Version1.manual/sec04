.sh 1 "WAVELENGTH ASSIGNMENTS " 6


.sh 2 "Wavelengths "
.pp
The wavelengths can be stored in any of 20 "wavelength files".
Wavelength file 1 can contain up to 256 points while files 2
through 20 can contain up to 255 points.  Although it is called a
wavelength file, it is really the horizontal axis values which
correspond to the data files (the vertical axis data values).
The "wavelength file" could actually be time, phase angle, or
whatever you wish to plot.  Then, when you actually do a plot, you
can label the horizontal axis (and vertical axis) anything you
want (e.g. time, phase angle, wavelength, etc.).  This makes the
program more than a spectrum processing program.  Wavelengths will
be assumed to be in the wavelength file for the rest of this
manual, but it is understood that it could be other data (e.g.
time).
.pp
The wavelength assignments also sets the number of channels to be
processed (2 to 256).  The number of channels is stored in memory
for wavelength file 1 and in channel 256 for files 2 through 20.


.sh 2 "'Wedge' CVF Wavelengths "
.pp
Wavelengths of the standard "Wedge" CVF spectrometer can be
generated with small calibration shifts by typing
.ul
W
and then the calibration shift in angstroms when asked.  The
program will then ask which wavelength file to store the
wavelengths.  The number of channels is set to 120.  Table 6.2.1
shows the CVF wavelengths.


.sh 2 "PDS Nominal Wavelengths "
.pp
The Nominal wavelengths of the PDS photometer are generated and
stored by typing
.ul
P.
Then type in the wavelength file number.  The number of
channels is set to 25.  Table 6.3.1 shows the PDS nominal
wavelengths.


.sh 2 "Read Wavelengths "
.pp
To read data from V, W, D, U, or Y and put it in the wavelength
file, type
.ul
R.
Now type in the file ID (V, W, D, U, or Y), the file number, a
space, and the number of channels.  Next type in the wavelength
file number.


.sh 2 "Write Wavelengths "
.pp
To write data from the wavelength file to tape or disc (V or D),
type
.ul
T.
Next type in the file ID (V or D) and file number of where to
write the wavelengths.  The file number is set to the protected
file plus 1 for device V, but you must give a nonzero number.
For example, type
.ul
V1
and, if the protection is 153, the wavelengths will be written to
V154.  You will also have to type in a title, history, manual
history, date, and the wavelength file number before the data is
written.


.sh 2 "Type In Your Own Wavelengths "
.pp
To type in your own wavelengths, type
.ul
Y.
Then type in the number, and return for each channel.  When you
are through typing in wavelengths, type
.ul
N.
The number of channels will be set.  Then type in the wavelength
file number.  If you wish to stop input and not write the
wavelengths to the wavelength file, type
.ul
X.


.sh 2 "Change Channel Number "
.pp
To change the number of channels, type
.ul
C.
Then type in the number of channels and the wavelength file
number.


.sh 2 "Edit Wavelengths "
.pp
Type
.ul
D
to edit the wavelength file.  The wavelength file number given in
the header information will be read into memory for editing.
Then type
.ul
P
to print the wavelengths or
.ul
X
to exit the editor.  To edit, you type in the channel number and
the wavelength of that channel.  The numbers must be between
1.0E-7
and 1.0E+6 or -1.0.  A value of -1.0 is no wavelength value
for this channel.  Then type in the wavelength file number of
where you wish to store the edited wavelengths.


.sh 2 "Wavelength Routine Capabilities "
.pp
The capabilities of the wavelength routines allow you to generate
your own wavelengths by typing them in yourself, creating them
from math operations or editing.  Since the wavelengths can be
treated as data when written to V or D, you can create your own
data or edit existing data.  Similarly data written to the
wavelength file can be treated as wavelengths, time, phase angle,
or whatever you wish.

.sh 1 "PROGRAM OPERATIONS CONTROL "


.sh 2 "Introduction "
.pp
The Program Operations Control is the main part of the program
which allows access to math operations, file list, overlay,
transfer, display, plot, file assignments and initialization.
This is also the only point where the program should be
terminated.


.sh 2 "Screen Information "
.pp
Information on the screen can be suppressed by typing
.ul
IN
or restored by typing
.ul
I.


.sh 2 "Calling File List "
.pp
To list the contents of the devices (V, W, D, U, or Y), type in
the corresponding letter.  See section 11 for further
instructions.


.sh 2 "Terminating Program "
.pp
To terminate the program, type
.ul
EX.
All files and devices will be closed properly.


.sh 2 "Calling File Display, Transfer, and Overlap "
.pp
To transfer files, or display or overlap spectra on the CRT, type
.ul
T.
See section 10 for further information.


.sh 2 "Changing Initialization Parameters "
.pp
To change the initialization parameters or return to the
wavelength assignment routines, type
.ul
B.
The B is left over from the MIT program version meaning go back
to the Beginning of the program.  From here you can change the
observatory location (section 4.3), device names (section 4.4),
return to the wavelength assignments (section 6), change the
device protection (section 4.2), or return to Device and File
Assignments (section 5).  A multiple command is allowed to go
from Program Operations Control directly to the initialization
parameter of interest.  To do this, type
.ul
B
and then the control letter(s) of the parameter to be changed;
then press return.  For example, to change protection, you could
type
.ul
B,
return, then the program lists options, then you type
.ul
CP
to change protection, or you could type
.ul
BCP
from Program Operations Control to get to the same point faster
(see Figure 2.1-1 for the control structure).


.sh 2 "Calling Device and File Assignments "
.pp
To go the Device and File Assignments, type
.ul
R
(section 5).


.sh 2 "Calling Extinction Routines "
.pp
To create a starpack or list the starpack file by titles, type
.ul
S
(section 12).


.sh 2 "Calling EOF Routines "
.pp
To write an end of file on the magnetic tapes, type
.ul
F
(section 14).


.sh 2 "Calling Gould Plot Routines "
.pp
To plot spectra on the Gould Printer Plotter, type
.ul
P
(section 13).


.sh 2 "Calling Math Operations "
.pp
Press return or type
.ul
M
to go to math operations (section 8).
