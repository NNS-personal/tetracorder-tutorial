special Functions Special function subroutines are additional routines for operating on any kind of data 
.
 sentence length: 15 SIMPLE  readability 14.33 : begins with adjective

subroutine calls already exist in the program for many as yet unwritten routines .
 sentence length: 13 SIMPLE  readability 9.71 : begins with adjective

these routines are designed for easy linking to the present program .
 sentence length: 11 SIMPLE :passive: readability 8.48 : begins with adjective

new routines can be user written with less effort than a completely separate program since 
, in most cases , specpr handles all the data management .
 sentence length: 24 COMPLEX  readability 14.12 : begins with adjective

the routines are called by the letter f and the function number .
 sentence length: 12 SIMPLE :passive: readability 4.98 : begins with article

an example would be to call function 2 to operate on file v record 10 
: v10 f2 note there is no colon as in the algebraic and trig routines .
 sentence length: 29 SIMPLE  readability 10.77 : begins with article

some special functions do not require a file to be input before the function command 
.
 sentence length: 15 COMPLEX  readability 8.05 : begins with adjective

an example is function 1 which is a list of all available functions ( type f1 
only ) .
 sentence length: 16 COMPLEX  readability 5.70 : begins with article

functions which require a file input before the function call will have an f in 
parenthesis in the list of functions ( f1 ) .
 sentence length: 22 COMPLEX  readability 10.55 : begins with noun

similarly , an e will also be in parenthesis if an error analysis can be included 
.
 sentence length: 15 COMPLEX :passive: readability 6.48 : begins with adverb

the available functions are described below .
 sentence length: 6 SIMPLE :passive: readability 11.40 : begins with article

 sentence length: 9 SIMPLE  readability 11.33 : begins with noun

shift f2 shifts data left or right an integer or fractional number of channels .
 sentence length: 14 SIMPLE  readability 7.44 : begins with adjective

a file input is required and errors can be included .
 sentence length: 10 COMPOUND :passive: readability 3.35 : begins with article

fractional shifts are done by linear interpolation .
 sentence length: 7 SIMPLE :passive: readability 11.68 : begins with adjective

when the routine has been entered , type in the number of channels to shift or 
type e or x to exit .
 sentence length: 20 COMPLEX :passive: readability 6.23 : begins with 

a positive number ( integer or real ) indicates a shift right and a negative number left 
.
 sentence length: 15 SIMPLE  readability 8.05 : begins with article

if X is the number of channels to shift , the value of X is split 
into the integer part ( n ) and the fractional part ( xn ) .
 sentence length: 24 COMPLEX  readability 7.84 : begins with 

first , the integer part is shifted x x where 0 i n 257 and D 
sub i is each data point in the spectrum .
 sentence length: 22 COMPLEX :passive: readability 5.63 : begins with adverb

next , the fractional part is interpolated x x where XN' - 1.0 xn .
 sentence length: 9 COMPLEX :passive: readability 7.14 : begins with adverb

data channels not in the shifted region are set to zero .
 sentence length: 11 SIMPLE :passive: readability 3.34 : begins with adjective

the errors to the data are shifted in a similar manner .
 sentence length: 11 SIMPLE :passive: readability 2.91 : begins with article

before June 24 , 1979 , there was a slight error in the program ( XN' xn ) making 
the fractional shift appear to go in a different direction than the integer part shift 
.
 sentence length: 29 COMPLEX  readability 14.02 : begins with 

the history has been modified to signal this new change Old history ( X 2.5 operation 
on WDG536 file 238 ) : " F2 : WDG536 file 238 shift right 2.5 channels " New History : " F2 
: WDG536 file 238 shift right ( ) 2.5 channels " .
 sentence length: 37 SIMPLE :passive: readability 18.20 : begins with article

the subtle change is the sign ( or - ) in parentheses signifying the direction of the shift 
.
 sentence length: 15 SIMPLE  readability 8.36 : begins with article

sequential Processor This routine is very useful for repetitive calculations on many records for multiplication 
, division , subtraction and special functions only .
 sentence length: 21 COMPOUND  readability 20.25 : begins with adjective

for example , if you wanted to multiply file v records 10 to 23 by the 
constant 1.3452 , you would type f3 from Math Operations .

next the program will ask for the first file id , beginning record number , ending record 
number and the record number increment .
 sentence length: 21 SIMPLE  readability 12.40 : begins with adverb

for this example , you would type v10 23 1 .
 sentence length: 9 SIMPLE  readability -0.18 : begins with preposition

record increments from 0 to 2000 are valid .
 sentence length: 8 SIMPLE  readability 3.18 : begins with adjective

if the record increment was negative , it is set to zero .
 sentence length: 11 COMPLEX :passive: readability 2.91 : begins with 

next you will be asked to type in the second file id , beginning and ending 
record numbers and increment .
 sentence length: 19 SIMPLE :passive: readability 8.89 : begins with adverb

for this case , you would type c1 .3452 .
 sentence length: 8 SIMPLE  readability 0.23 : begins with preposition

you will then be asked to type in options .
 sentence length: 9 SIMPLE :passive: readability 0.34 : begins with pronoun

if you wanted errors included , the record increment should have been 2 since the data 
and errors take up 2 records .
 sentence length: 21 COMPLEX  readability 9.93 : begins with 

note you can get in an infinite loop if the record increment is set to 
zero .
 sentence length: 16 COMPLEX :passive: readability 4.23 : begins with noun

however , you can exit back to Math Operations by typing x at any point .
 sentence length: 13 SIMPLE  readability 5.00 : begins with adverb

if you type e at any point in the processing , that operation will be skipped 
and the program will go on to the next operation .
 sentence length: 25 COMPOUND-COMPLEX :passive: readability 9.91 : begins with 

the operations are performed just as if you had typed in the commands one at 
a time or all one line separated by commas in Math Operations .
 sentence length: 27 COMPLEX :passive: readability 11.61 : begins with article

this function should save a lot of time and typing .
