 \# Radtran commands to compute scapolite reflectance spectra
 r

                    PROGRAM MREFLECT (version 3):
 This routine computes reflectance given:     
 wavelength, index of refractionand absorption coefficient


 Enter  1  to compute a normal reflectance spectra
           (you give mineral abundances and grain sizes)
 Enter  2  to iterate to a optimum grain size on one mineral

 To derive mineral abundances and grain sizes from a reflectance spectrum:
 Enter  3  to use another method of convergence

 1
 Type in the file id and record number of the wavelength set
 Y393
To DELETE channels, type d and the channels to be deleted
  
 type in the number of input optical index sets 9 = maximum
 1          \# one mineral
x=  1.00000
      1 optical index sets allowed in this computation
type in the file ids and record numbers of the  real index of refraction,
 for element  1
 y399       \# index of ref for scapolite

 index of refraction set
      1     Scapolite (Xme=.8) est INDX REF .2-5um       channels=   512

type in the file ids and record numbers of the  absorption coefficient,
 for element  1
 y401        \# absorption coefficient for scapolite

absorption coefficient set
      1     Scapolite HS351 ABS COEF .2-5um 512ch        channels=   512

 For optical index data set  1 type in the following (on the same line):
  grain size in centimeters  weight fraction  and density
 0.01 1 2.7   \# grain size, weight, density
 Type in the angle of INCIDENCE, the angle of EMISSION and the PHASE angle in decimal degrees
 or g for GEOMETRIC ALBEDO followed by the degree  increment
  or <cr> for default increment
 0 30
Do you want to normalize the computation to ideal reflectance
standard at the same viewing geometry (enter y for yes)
NOTE: for proper geom albed values must normalize
 y
Enter s value. (Default equals .3)
  
Enter grain size dependence parameters:
          The grain size dependence equation has the form:

                    d = ddflt/(1.0 + df * (w0 - wavelength))

           where wavelength and w0 are in microns.
          Enter df and w0  (example: df, w0= 0.1 2.5), default = 0.0 2.5.
