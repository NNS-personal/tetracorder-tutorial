<p align=center>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>1.1 Introduction The SPECtrum Processing Routines
(SPECPR) is a large scale interactive program for general
one dimensional array processing, and optimized for
reflectance spectroscopy data and analysis. The program
processes one-dimensional arrays up to 4852 data points and
the operations include addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, trigonometric functions,
logarithmic and exponential functions, and many more
specialized routines. The specpr user interface is a menu
driven, character command system with all user input entered
as ascii characters to the program. User commands are
thoroughly checked for the context in which they will be
used. This provides for essentially all user input mistakes
to be caught and appropriate error messages to be issued.
The user interface also allows for command aliasing,
variable substitutions, command history and batch command
processing to occur at any point in the program. The user
can also control his or her own variables, increment and
decrement them, and monitor certain internal variables. This
flexibility allows for sophisticated programming, e.g. from
specific computations, to management of a database. All
arrays are treated as one dimensional lists of numbers, each
with an appropriate header for identification and history.
Any array can be plotted versus another array, and each axis
labeled appropriately. For example, you may plot a
reflectance spectrum versus wavelength or wavelength versus
reflectance. The array type is simply a label, so data like
temperature versus time can be treated just as easily as a
reflectance spectrum. Some routines are specific to certain
purposes, however. For example, the Planck black body
generator is specific to intensity versus wavelength,
whereas a smoothing routine could operate equally on
reflectance versus wavelength or temperature versus time.
Each array element can have an error bar associated with it
and errors are propagated through all appropriate routines.
Data points can be marked deleted and deleted points are
tracked appropriately. These features allow the program to
be effectively used on real world data. This philosophy has
resulted in a flexible system for which a user can
manipulate data arrays efficiently. The program was designed
for analysis of laboratory, field, telescopic, and
spacecraft spectroscopic data, and although general in
nature, there are biases built in. For example, horizontal
axis labels default to wavelength in micrometers, but the
defaults can be changed. Because of the orientation in
specpr to process planetary and terrestrial data, and the
need to access such data, specpr has been extended to have
access to non-specpr default file types. In particular,
specpr can &quot;skewer&quot; an 3-dimensional (3D) data
file along any of the three axes. Further, block skewers can
be done with the standard deviation of the mean computed for
each channel in the block. Currently, specpr can access any
of the standard file types common in the terrestrial and
planetary remote sensing communities. Details on 3D file I/O
are given in Chapter 6. Specpr has multiple record types
available within a single specpr data file. Currently
defined record types are data and text. In a data record, a
standard one dimensional array is held, along with its
header information. The header information includes a title,
history, dates and time of data acquisition and when the
data were last processed, the user who processed the data,
information typical of a spectrum like temperature and
viewing geometry, as well as pointers to wavelengths,
resolution, and text. If a spectrum is more than 256
channels in length, then the data gets put in succeeding
records in the file, and the following records are
continuation records. The second record type is the text,
where a title and a block of text (up to 19 kbytes) can be
stored. This record type is typically used for a description
of samples, experiments, instruments, or data processing for
a particular data set. It could also store the actual
commands used to create a spectrum. The commands for a
complicated plot for a publication might be stored in a text
record. That way, you can easily regenerate the plot, or
even write the commands to a non-specpr file, modify them
with any editor and reexecute them. The file types, text and
command processing, combined with the math and special
functions, provide for very powerful and general analysis
tool. These facilities also provide the framework for
database management.</p>

<p>1.2 History of Specpr The program began in 1975 at the
M.I.T. Wallace Observatory, on a Harris 2024 computer, as a
short routine to subtract or divide 2 spectra from the
Remote Sensing Laboratory Circular Variable filter
spectrometer (&quot;The Wedge&quot;). Due to lack of
processing software, the program grew to fill the Wedge data
reduction needs. Over the years, the program has grown to
serve more and more applications. The reason specpr has
survived is because of the philosophy behind each
application routine that was added: it should be of a
general nature, have checking of user input so that data are
not inadvertently destroyed, give a history of all
operations, and track deleted points because most data are
not perfect. After the initial development of specpr at the
MIT Remote Sensing Lab (RSL), the lab moved to the Institute
for Astronomy of the University of Hawaii in June 1977. At
that time, there was no software for reduction of spectral
data. It was decided that the Wedge data reduction program
should be put on the new computer (TI 980 B) as a general
spectrum and one dimensional array processing system. In the
next 3 years, the program was written to handle the many
types of astronomical photometry being obtained by the group
at the Institute. In 1980, Specpr was moved from the
overworked TI 980 B to the newly acquired LSI 11/23 system
running the UNIX operating system. The historical
development of specpr up to this point solidified some of
the commands used in the program. The initial specpr
routines (pre 1980) were designed with data reduction
strategy for a particular method of astronomical observing.
That strategy is still there, but must be modified for other
methods, for example reduction of laboratory spectroscopy
data. The TI 980 B and LSI 11/23 versions of specpr were
based on 16 bit words whereas the MIT version was based on a
24 bit word machine, and that resulted in certain array
sizes that are still in place. During the change to the TI
980 B, many of the letter command codes and array sizes were
changed to fit more general cases. Also during the change to
the LSI version all of the routines were rewritten in Ratfor
with a few in C and the program was broken up into about 25
separate programs due to the lack of a decent overlay linker
for the Fortran compiler. This Ratfor conversion apparently
took place because the programmer who did it was a C
programmer, and liked Ratfor better than FORTRAN 66 (this
happened before FORTRAN 77 became widely available). In
1984, the program was moved to the U. S. Geological Survey
in Denver. The new spectrometers at the USGS necessitated
many changes, mostly because the USGS machines produced more
data points per spectrum. Research directions also played a
role in the analysis routines developed. The study of high
resolution spectra, absorption band analysis, radiative
transfer mixing models, and the desire to manage spectral
databases necessitated major changes to the functionality of
specpr. The latest analysis area for specpr development is
access to imaging spectrometer data cubes. This access
allows a user to query large data sets for spectra and then
analyze those spectra in detail.</p>

<p>1.3 Specpr Design Philosophy Specpr is designed to meet
the needs of the remote sensing spectroscopist for detailed
analysis of spectral data. In that sense, it is not designed
to analyze whole image cubes (hundreds of thousands of
spectra), but smaller numbers (ones to several thousands)
where the user must become intimately knowledgeable about
the data quality and results. One of the main goals of the
program is to be uncrashable. Since users sit at the
terminal for many hours processing data, they are bound to
make mistakes, so another goal is for the program to be
somewhat &quot;intelligent&quot; and to try and catch
mistakes. The program is completely free format allowing
quick and easy input of commands. Spaces are required
between two numbers only when there is no character between
them. Otherwise, spaces can be completely left out or
inserted wherever the user wishes. Most commands are a
single character. With the many programs and options in
specpr, an individual letter is used for more than one
command. For example in one section of the program, the
command &quot;l&quot; may mean list a file, but in another,
say a plot routine, it may mean line type. Thus a command is
context dependent. The menus in each routine give the
commands and options available to the users. In many batch
processing systems, the user types commands in a file, and
then directs the files into a program for processing. If
there was a mistake, the job must be run again, and this
wastes time. In the interactive version, as the commands are
typed in, they are executed immediately and the results
displayed. In this way, all intermediate steps are seen, and
decisions can be made to change the processing in order to
obtain the best results. Specpr commands can be read from a
file starting and terminating at any point in the program,
thus giving batch capability. Commands can also be saved in
a text file as they are typed in. Then, if a mistake is
made, the text file can be edited and executed again. Specpr
maintains a complete history (within reason) of each
operation. This has proved invaluable for figuring out what
was done to some data whether it is yours or someone
else&rsquo;s. Any time there is a question of the results of
a particular analysis, anyone can trace and verify whether
or not everything was done correctly. However, for specpr to
properly record histories, certain steps must be followed,
for it is possible to subvert any history mechanism. One
possible way to subvert the history is to put intermediate
products in a temporary file, then delete the file and only
keep the final product. Specpr records the history of the
last operation of each spectrum, so to trace a complete
history, all intermediate steps must be kept. This is not
really a limitation, because spectral data are small in
comparison to the size of modern computer disk space. An
interactive &quot;smart&quot; program of this nature
requires an almost shocking amount of code. Specpr is now
about 50,000 lines of Ratfor and C in length, contains over
400 subroutines, and takes about 1.5 megabytes of memory to
run. For reference, specpr was first described by Clark
(1980, Publications of the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific, 221-224).</p>
