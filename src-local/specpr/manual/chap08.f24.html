F24:  Star Moon Thermal Removal                         Alias = star[moontherm]
This routine removes the thermal component from
the reflectance of a lunar spectrum using a standard star as a
reference.  This routine was written by the University of Hawaii,
Planetary Geosciences Division as a modification to special function
11 (Lunar Thermal Removal, page 8-f11.1).  See that manual page for
related operation.  The specific manual page for this function will
be written by people at the UH.
