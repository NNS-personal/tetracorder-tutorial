HP Graphics are performed by writing on logical unit 6

The subroutines for graphics are:


SUBROUTINE  INITT (I)

            Sets the graphics mode:

            g2   HP2393A compatible graphics, Set White on Black mode
            g3   HP2393A compatible graphics, Compliment, White on Black mode
            g4   HP2393A compatible graphics, Jam mode, white on black (DEFAULT)
            g11  HP2393A compatible graphics, Set Black on White mode
            g13  HP2393A compatible graphics, Compliment, Black on White mode

            g20  Tektronix Plot 10 compatible graphics terminals
            g21  DEC VT240 with (sort of) Tektronix Plot 10 graphics
            g22  GTERM (Tektronix window in a Sun gterm window)

            g50  X-Windows using an hpterm window (see X-NOTE below)
            g51  X-Windows using an xterm window (see X-NOTE below)

            g99  Scrolling mode (non-graphics terminal)
            g100 Televideo 914 alphanumeric terminal with no graphics

            Other numbers <10 = Jam mode, White on black (default)
            Other numbers >10 = Jam mode, black on white

            The subroutine RESPAG is called  then  the  line
            type is set to 1.

            X-Windows NOTES:

o+  When running X-windows, the environment variable  DISPLAY
   must be set to your X server.

o+ Every time you enter specpr, you  must  re-initialize  the
   graphics window by typing g50 or g51 or by specifying the
   graphics mode on the command line as specified in section
   3.1.

o+ User input always comes from the text  window  except  for
   mouse  button  clicks  which  are entered in the graphics
   window.

o+ If the graphics window is hidden and then exposed, it will
   not be redrawn.

SUBROUTINE  OTHTRM

            is called by other graphics if the graphics mode
            is  set to 99 (see INITT) each call to this sub-
            routine scrolls the terminal 6 lines.


SUBROUTINE  HPLINE (I)

            Sets the line type

            I    = 0 increment line type, 1 to 10 but not  2
                 or 3
                 = 1 Set line type = 1
                 = 2 not valid
                 = 3 not valid
                 = 4 through 10:  set line type = I

                 If I < 0 or > 10, I is reset to 1


SUBROUTINE  HRESET (I)

            Resets the terminal

            I    = 0:  hard reset
                 =/ 0:  turn off graphics display and  graph-
                 ics text and turn on alpha display


SUBROUTINE  HBELL (I)

            Sounds the Bell I times.

                 if I < 0 there is a 1 second delay  between
                 beeps


SUBROUTINE  VGRMOD

            Sets the terminal to the vector graphics drawing
            mode.



SUBROUTINE  RESPAG

            Resets the graphics to the terminal by:   graph-
            ics  on,  clear,  alpha  off, Zoom = 1, graphics
            cursor on, graphics text on,  rubber  band  line
            off,  cursor at top left line of screen (coordi-
            nates 0, 350) and programs this into the f5 but-
            ton on the terminal.  calls VGRMOD

SUBROUTINE  HPPLOT

            Puts the terminal in plotting mode



SUBROUTINE  DRWABS (IX, IY)

            Draws a vector from the current cursor  position
            to absolute position IX, IY.  (pen is down) Data
            is sent in absolute binary for the fastest  pos-
            sible  graphics  commands.   Calls HPPLOT if the
            terminal is not in plotting mode.  Calls HPABS



SUBROUTINE  MOVABS (IX, IY)

            Moves the cursor to absolute position  (IX,  IY)
            (pen  is  up).   Data is sent in absolute binary
            for the fastest possible graphics commands Calls
            HPPLOT  if the terminal is not in plotting mode.
            Calls HPABS


SUBROUTINE  HPABS (IX, IY)

            Converts IX, IY to absolute binary  (by  calling
            ABSBIN)  and  sends  the converted values to the
            terminal.



SUBROUTINE  SB (I)

            Calls TEXMOD, sets the graphics mode to  I  (see
            INITT) and calls VGRMOD.  (if I = 0, only TEXMOD
            is called)


SUBROUTINE  TMOVE

            This subroutine moves the  text  cursor  to  the
            last graphics cursor position as given by DRWABS
            or MOVABS.  calls CONVRT



SUBROUTINE  TEXMOD

            This subroutine sets the terminal to the  graph-
            ics  text  mode  and  calls TMOVE.  This routine
            must be called each time you want to do  a  FOR-
            TRAN write or read after performing graphics.

                 Sample:  draw an X on the screen and  write
                 Hello, and sound Bell:
