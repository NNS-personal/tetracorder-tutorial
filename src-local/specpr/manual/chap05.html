<p align=center>CHAPTER 5</p>

<p align=center>BASIC PROGRAM SETUP</p>

<p>5.1 Introduction This section describes the steps
necessary to basically configure specpr for working with
data. This section describes the basic setup. To start with
no setup, you must enter no arguments on the command line
(see Chapter 3).</p>

<p>5.2 Beginning As the program is started, messages
relating to recent changes to specpr are printed. These
messages can be skipped with command line flags; see Chapter
3 for details on how to start specpr from the operating
system. However, to start specpr from scratch and do a basic
setup, you can&rsquo;t skip messages. When specpr starts
with messages, the program is actually a Unix text viewing
program (usually it is configured to be the program
&quot;more&quot;, but it could vary depending on your local
specpr administrator). Assuming you are in the Unix
&quot;more&quot; program, if you wish to skip these messages
type &quot;q&quot; to quit, or type the space bar to see the
next page of information. After specpr messages have been
printed, specpr asks you to press return before continuing.
As soon as you do, the SPECPR version date will be written
on the screen. Two options are available at this point:
Type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="37%"></td>
<td width="62%">
<p>u &lt;filename&gt;</p></td>
</table>

<p>to create a new restart file or type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="37%"></td>
<td width="62%">
<p>r &lt;filename&gt;</p></td>
</table>

<p>to use an existing restart file. A restart routine is
used so that SPECPR may be exited and later restarted with
the same files assigned and protection and other parameters
the same as the time of the exit. The restart parameters are
stored in a disc file and are updated periodically, as new
sections of specpr are entered during normal operation. See
Chapter 3 for additional information on restart and restart
files.</p>

<p>5.3 Protection The next section for basic setup is the
file protections. Protections are set before files are
assigned, so that the protections will be in place when the
files get assigned in a following step. Some users think
this is backwards, but it is just another safety precaution.
When assigning protections to each file ID, anticipate which
files will be assigned in the file assignments section so
that they will be correct. Plan your basic setup. Specpr
protection is designed to protect your data. Proper use is
very important, because if your data are not protected, it
takes only one little typing mistake to destroy something
important! In specpr, all files may be totally or partially
protected, or completely unprotected. The fourth line of the
CRT header gives the protection status for all six devices
(devices v, w, d, u, v, and s).</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="94%">
<p>&bull; If the protection number is positive or zero, the
device is a read/write device where you can read up to and
including the protection, but you can only write to the
protection +1 record. For example, a value of 637 means you
can read the first 637 records, and you can only write to
record 638.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>&bull; A protection number of -1 means totally
unprotected so you may read or write anywhere in the file
randomly.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>&bull; A protection number of less than -1 means the
device is a read-only device where you can read up to the
absolute value protection number. For example, a value of
-264 means 264 records are read only and you can&rsquo;t
write to the file.</p>
</td>
</table>

<p>You can set the protections on many files on one command
line. Example:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="81%">
<p>v0 d-1 u432 y-600 w-600 s-50</p></td>
</table>

<p>where v0 means to protect 0 files on device v (write to
file 1 only, 0 files can be read); u432 means to protect up
to record 432 (write to record 433); y-600 means that y is a
read-only device with 600 records; similarly for w; and s is
a read-only file with 50 records. If the protection number
is zero or positive, it is incremented each time the device
is written to. See section 2.3 for more details on file
protection.</p>

<p>5.4 Observatory Location The observatory location is
used by specpr to compute air mass in astronomical data
reductions, or for example, terrestrial field observations
if the position of the sun were important. If you are not
doing astronomical extinction corrections, this is not
applicable and the not applicable, &quot;na&quot; flag
should be set. The request for observatory location looks
like:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="94%">
<p>v = *unasnd*: f 1 w = *unasnd*: f 1 d = *unasnd*: f 1<br>
u = *unasnd*: f 1 y = *unasnd*: f 1 s = starpack: f 1<br>
lp: spoolfile obs lat= .000 deg channels= 256 wav fl=C 256
h<br>
file protection: v 0,w 0,d 0,u 0,y 0,s 0 ltype= 0<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
type in observatory or location: type mko for mauna kea
observatory<br>
type na for not applicable<br>
type wal for wallace observatory<br>
type mwo for mount wilson observatory<br>
type kpn for kitt peak national obs.<br>
type t to type in the coordinates of the observing site.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Three-letter codes are shown for often used
observatories. If you wish another observatory location,
type</p>
</td>
</table>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="37%"></td>
<td width="62%">
<p>t</p></td>
</table>

<p>and then the program will request the latitude in
degrees, minutes, seconds, free format. Longitude is not
needed because the sidereal time is contained with each
spectrum. The observatory location is used only in computing
the air mass in the object-sky subtraction routine.</p>

<p>5.5 Device and File Assignments The device and file
assignments menu with a new start looks like:</p>
<pre>   v = *unasnd*: f    1    w = *unasnd*: f    1    d = *unasnd*: f    1
   u = *unasnd*: f    1    y = *unasnd*: f    1    s = starpack: f    1
   lp: spoolfile       obs lat=    .000 deg   channels= 256 wav fl=C  256 h
   file protection: v     0,w     0,d     0,u     0,y     0,s     0 ltype= 0
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 *** FILE ASSIGNMENTS ***
                 -----------------------------------
   to reassign files type letter and name:
      (74 characters max per file name)
   v = /dev/null
   w = /dev/null
   d = /dev/null
   s = /dev/null
   u = /dev/null
   y = /dev/null
   l = spoolfile
       e  or  x = EXIT this routine
</pre>

<p>To assign a file you type in the file ID letter followed
by the file name. But there can be qualifiers, and Chapter 6
is devoted to the details of file assignments. The listing
device can be a file or the line printer spooler. To have
the listing device assigned to the line printer spooler,
specify a name of &quot;spoolfile&quot; for ID l as shown in
the above menu. Specpr will write all lists to a file in the
current directory, and when the list is complete, it will
send the file to the spooler and truncate file length to
zero length in preparation for the next listing.</p>

<p>5.6 Data File Names The next step in basic setup is to
assign the names to each file ID. The names entered here are
VERY IMPORTANT for the history mechanism of specpr. The
names entered here should reflect the archive name where the
data will ultimately be stored. Traditionally, these names
have been the names of the mag tapes from which the data
comes or to which it will be written. The names are a
maximum of 8 characters. You must be certain these names are
correct if you want the histories to be correct. See section
2.3.1 for more details of why this is so important.</p>

<p>5.7 Graphics Options There are several graphics options
available in this program. They were implemented to allow
specpr to be run from different terminals, for example
HP2623A, HP2648A, non-graphics terminals. Please note that
the graphics option does not show up at the beginning of a
new restart, but has to be set from the Initialize Parameter
Routine via Program Operations. To change the terminal
configuration, go to program operations control and type
&quot;g#&quot; where # is a number from the table below. If
you type g and a return with no number, it is equivalent to
typing g4. Options not in the table default to HP graphics.
These are the options available:</p>
<pre>        g2   HP2393A compatible graphics, Set White on Black mode
        g3   HP2393A compatible graphics, Compliment, White on Black mode
        g4   HP2393A compatible graphics, Jam mode, white on black (DEFAULT)
        g11  HP2393A compatible graphics, Set Black on White mode
        g13  HP2393A compatible graphics, Compliment, Black on White mode

       g20  Tektronix Plot 10 compatible graphics terminals
        g21  DEC VT240 with (sort of) Tektronix Plot 10 graphics
        g22  GTERM (Tektronix window in a Sun gterm window)

       g50  X-Windows using an hpterm window (see X-NOTE below)
        g51  X-Windows using an xterm window (see X-NOTE below)

       g99  Scrolling mode (non-graphics terminal)
        g100 Televideo 914 alphanumeric terminal with no graphics

X-Windows NOTES:

&bull;  When running X-windows, the environment variable DISPLAY must
   be set to your X server.

&bull; Every time you enter specpr, you must re-initialize the graphics
   window by typing g50 or g51 or by specifying the graphics mode on the
   command line as specified in section 3.1.

&bull; User input always comes from the text window except for mouse
   button clicks which are entered in the graphics window.

&bull; If the graphics window is hidden and then exposed, it will not be
   redrawn.

5.8  Automatically Checking File Protection
The basic setup menu (type b from
the main menu) includes a command to evaluate current protections
compared to what protections might be based on file sizes.  This is
done by the &quot;f&quot; command.  The f command computes the number of
records in the file from the file size and assumes the protection
should be all records in the file.  If the protection
does not agree with the computed value, a warning message is printed
and you are given the option to change the protection to the
computed value.  Further, you are given the option to make the file
read only.  You should use this command any time you are not sure of
the proper file protection.
