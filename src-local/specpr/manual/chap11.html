<p align=center>DATA FILE LIST</p>

<p>11.1 Introduction The data file list routines read the
contents of a specpr data file and prints header information
and data on the terminal or to a print spooler. The user can
select different modes to print different fields, search for
strings and print only those found. The search capability
along with the ability to read selected records within a
file (given as a list of record numbers) can be used for
simple data base operations. The list routines can be
entered from Program Operations Control, Data Display
Transfer and Overlay, or from Math. To enter the list
routines, you type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>l&lt;ID&gt;</p></td>
</table>

<p>where &quot;&lt;ID&gt;&quot; means one of the specpr
file letter ID&rsquo;s: v, w, d, u, or y. At all user
command points in the list routines, an &quot;e&quot; or
&quot;x&quot; command will terminate the routine and return
you to program operations. NOTE: there is a new X-windows
based, &quot;point and click&quot; specpr data file viewer.
It is currently called &quot;sp&quot; and is available as
part of the pic-works (pw) software package.</p>

<p>11.2 Listing Mode When you first enter the list
routines, you are given the option to print in
&quot;laboratory&quot; or &quot;telescopic&quot; mode:</p>
<pre>  ________________________________________________________
   type  t  for TELESCOPIC or  l  for LABORATORY (DEFAULT)
  or beginning and ending files to be listed
  ________________________________________________________
</pre>

<p>The telescopic mode prints the observation air mass
whereas the laboratory mode prints channels in that column.
The mode is different for both the terminal list and the
printer list. The printer listing always assumes a
132-character wide printer and is able to show more items
than the terminal listing. The default printer listing also
shows the sidereal time in telescopic mode.</p>

<p>11.3 CRT Listing Options After you select the
telescopic/laboratory mode, you are asked which items to
show on the terminal.</p>
<pre>  __________________________________________________________________
   *** CRT print options ***
  n  print # only on CRT when printing to lineprinter
  a  print wavelength record numbers
  h  print history
  t  print text
  r  read and print a list of comma separated record numbers
  w  write to a file, a list of comma separated record numbers
     You will be prompted for the file name after you select r or w.
  __________________________________________________________________
</pre>

<p>The &quot;n&quot; option speeds the operation when all
you desire is a printer listing. The &quot;a&quot; option
lists the wavelength pointers in place of the channel
numbers in laboratory mode. The &quot;h&quot; option adds
the history to the listing (this takes more than one line on
the terminal). The &quot;t&quot; option prints the text if
the data record type indicates a text record. As noted in
the introduction, the list routines can read only selected
records. Similarly, it can write the records it finds. For
example, if you do a complicated search, you can record the
record numbers found by the search and then read only those
numbers in subsequent listings. The file containing the
record numbers must have each record number separated by a
comma. If the number is the last on a line, it must still
have a comma. The &quot;r&quot; option directs the list
routines to read one of these lists, while the &quot;w&quot;
option directs it to create a list. You can both read and
write a list at the same time.</p>

<p>11.4 Printer Listing Options Next you enter the options
to decide what to print on the printer.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->

<td width="96%">
<pre>________________________________________________________
LINEPRINTER OPTIONS (return for CRT only)
   p  print titles + selected fields given by print mode
   a  print titles with no pausing at CRT page full

  with p or a, also select:
   h  print history
   m  manual history if not blank
   t  print text on text data files
   b  print all header info except manual history
   c  print all except data
   d  print all and data
________________________________________________________
</pre>
</td>
</table>

<p>If you press return, no printer output is created. To
create a printer listing, you must type either</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>p</p></td>
</table>

<p>or</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>a</p></td>
</table>

<p>If you type &quot;p&quot;, the terminal stops each time
the terminal screen is full, but if you type &quot;a&quot;
(for &quot;automatic, no stopping&quot;), the list continues
until the user limits are reached. With a &quot;p&quot; or
&quot;a&quot; command, you can select options as described
above. For example, to make a listing including the history,
type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>ph</p></td>
</table>

<p>11.5 Search Capability The next command prompt is for
search capability:</p>
<pre>  ___________________________________________________________
  Enter SEARCH STRING: letter &quot;string1&quot; letter &quot;string2&quot; etc.
         where letter is for t  title
                             h  history
                             d  date
                             m  manual history
         maximum number of strings is 4
         comparisons is and (default), use | for or, &amp; for and
  ___________________________________________________________
</pre>

<p>Pressing return does no search selection; all records
are printed. To limit the listing to a specific search
parameter, enter the search field (t, h, d, or m) and the
search string. The search string is a full Unix regular
expression. See the Unix string searching documentation with
your computer for more details. A few examples will be given
below. You may enter multiple search fields, as long as they
are less than 80 characters or less. They may include
multiple entries of the same type, however, such as two
different title strings. The date field is converted from
its numerical value to a string for this search capability.
The date field searched is the date of data acquisition.
Examples:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="15%"></td>
<td width="84%">
<pre>t&quot;Kaolinite&quot;         \# search for all Kaolinite
t&quot;[Kk]aolinite&quot;      \# search for all Kaolinite or kaolinite
t&quot;Kaolin&quot; t&quot;NN56&quot;    \# search for all entries that have Kaolin
                         and NN56 in the title.
t&quot;Kaolin&quot; d&quot;198[56]&quot; \# search for all Kaolin spectra obtained in
                         1985 or 1986
t&quot;Kaolin&quot; |t&quot;Alunite&quot;  \# search for all entries of Kaolin or
                           Alunite

<p>In the above examples, a &quot;&amp;&quot; was not
necessary because &quot;and&quot; id the default logical
operator.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>11.6 Listing Limits The final prompt before the
listing/search occurs is to enter the limits of the
search:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<pre>___________________________________________________
Type in the beginning and ending files to be listed
___________________________________________________
</pre>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>If the lower limit is zero, it is reset to 1. If the
upper limit is greater than the protection limit, it is
reset to the protection value.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>11.7 Continuing/Ending the List When the listing is
complete, or the terminal page is full, you can continue, or
exit to one of 3 places as described by the prompt:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<pre>__________________________________________________________________________
Type  c  to continue, e or x  to exit,  Type in new record numbers to list
type  r  to return to options, type t to go to file display and transfer
or type m to go to math routines
__________________________________________________________________________
</pre>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>If you type c to continue and you are at the upper limit
given above, but that upper limit is less than the
protection value, the listing/search will continue up to the
protection limit. To continue with a new range, do not type
&quot;c,&quot; just the new range of record numbers.</p>
