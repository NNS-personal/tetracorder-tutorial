<p align=center>CRT PLOT ROUTINES</p>

<p>9.1 Introduction The CRT plot routines are a set of
routines for data display, overlay, header information
display and change, data print-out, and specific
graphics-oriented routines to read data values off of the
plot and to analyze specific absorption features. The CRT
plot routines are called from the completion of a Math
Operation (Chapter 8) or from the File Display, Transfer and
Overlay routines (Chapter 10). Any x-y paired data may be
plotted. The horizontal axis may be labeled to properly
describe the data; the default horizontal-axis label is
&quot;Wavelength (microns)&quot;, but the default can be
overridden. Data may also be plotted as a function of
channel number, or the x-axis values inverted in which case
the default units of microns is assumed and the program
converts the units to wavenumber in inverse centimeters. The
CRT plot routines also have a facility for removing spikes
or glitches in data by assuming the glitch was caused by a
bad bit in the data. The user may also elect to change any
channel to a deleted point.</p>

<p>9.2 Plotting Mode The plot mode is selected by the
command letters</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="73%">
<pre>h    for channel,
a    for wavelength, or
n    for energy (inverse wavelength).
</pre>
</td>
</table>

<p>When you have a plot on the screen, change the plot type
by entering h, a, or n and return. The menu for these
commands is always located at the bottom of the plot screen.
Note the characters chosen are the second letter of channel,
wavelength, and energy since the first letters are used for
other commands. The energy mode assumes the wavelengths are
in microns, and the inverse wavelengths are computed in
wavenumber.</p>

<p>9.3 Changing Scale The scale of the CRT plot is
controlled by four values: the minimum and maximum for the
horizontal (&quot;wavelength&quot;) axis and similarly for
the vertical axis. The plot scale may be changed by a
command where the user types the desired limits, or by
graphically selecting a window within the current
window.</p>

<p>9.3.1 Changing Scale by Typing in the Range The scale is
changed by typing the</p>

<pre>______________________________________________________________________________
 Current Scale: VERTICAL= 0.0000E+00   2.0000E+00
                HORIZ.  = Automatic

To scale the plot, type in the mode (n or w) and horizontal axis limits first.
 When the vertical scale is entered, the routine will exit to the plot.

HORIZONTAL:
 type  n  and left and right hand limits for INVERSE WAVELENGTH, or:
 type  w  and left and right hand WAVELENGTH limits
          (if you type  w  only,  the program will AUTOSCALE the limits
          from the current wavelength set)

VERTICAL:
 Type lower bound and upper bound values for the VERTICAL AXIS, or:
 type  A  to AUTO SCALE (the VERTICAL AXIS), or:
______________________________________________________________________________
</pre>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>In order to change the horizontal axis range, you MUST
change its range before the vertical axis. As soon as the
vertical axis range has been changed, the routine
automatically exits and the plot is redone. For example, to
change the scale from 0.0 to 1.1 from the CRT plot, type</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<pre>            c
            0 1.2
</pre>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>command sequence. If you wish to change the horizontal
scale to 0.2 to 3.0 and the vertical scale to 0.5 to 1.3,
type the</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->

            w.2 3

</pre>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>command sequence. The format is completely free: there is
no need to add a decimal point on integers. If you type a
mistake, the routine will flag it and ask you to retype the
values. Specpr allows commands to be separated by
semicolons, so it is often desirable to see the plot while
changing the scale. This can be done all from the CRT plot
screen: enter the &quot;c&quot; command and the ranges
separated by semicolons. Thus</p>

<p>9.3.2 Changing Scale by Graphics Sub-Window A window
within the current window may be selected to change the plot
scale using the graphics cursor. NOTE: this option currently
only works on X-windows or Hewlett Packard compatible
graphics terminals. To change the sub-window, type the</p>

       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="73%">

</table>

<p>command from the CRT plot command screen. The CRT menu
will be erased and a new menu written asking you to position
the graphics cursor at the position on the plot where you
want the upper left corner of the new sub-window. Place the
graphics cursor at the correct position and press the return
key. Next you will be instructed to select the lower right
corner. Place the graphics cursor at the desired lower right
corner and then press the return key. The CRT plot will then
be rescaled to the new window. Note that you can not use
this command to scale to windows larger than the current
window. It is, however, a very useful command for enlarging
small features on the plot.</p>

<p>9.4 Line Type Each data set on a CRT plot may have a
specific line type. The line types available may be
dependent on the terminal type, but the line type also has a
few different ways of plotting the data, for example by
including a small cross at the actual point on the plot.
Typing the</p>

<p>command (the lower case letter L) followed by a number
from 0 to 9 will change the line type used in the CRT plot.
The following shows the characteristics of line types on HP
series graphics terminals.</p>

         0      error bars included, crosses, not connected (+ + +)
         1      error bars included, crosses, connected (+&mdash;+&mdash;+)
         2      error bars excluded, points connected ( &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; )
         3      only small error bars excluded, points connected ( &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; )
         4      error bars excluded,  line: &mdash; - &mdash; - &mdash;
         5      error bars excluded,  line: &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
         6      error bars excluded,  line: &mdash;&mdash;  &mdash;&mdash;  &mdash;&mdash;
         7      error bars excluded,  line: ...........
         8      error bars excluded,  line: &mdash;&mdash; - &mdash;&mdash; - &mdash;&mdash; -
         9      error bars excluded,  line: --- --- ---
</pre>

<p>9.5 Horizontal Axis Labels The default axis label for
the specpr CRT plot is &quot;Wavelength (microns)&quot;, but
this label can be changed. The change is done in the
wavelength set by changing line 4 of the manual history. For
example, say you had a data set of intensity versus time,
and the time data set was in seconds. Change line 4 of the
manual history to read &quot;\\W Time (seconds)&quot; (no
quotes in the manual history), and the CRT plot horizontal
axis label will read &quot;Time (seconds)&quot;. The key
sequence for axis labels is the \\W (the backslash is
important).</p>

<p>9.6 Changing the Wavelength Set The wavelength set
contains the &quot;x-axis values&quot; which make the plot
of x-y paired data possible. The number of channels plotted
is also controlled by the wavelength set in use. For Math
operations, the number of channels that are written to the
data file is controlled by the wavelength set in use AT THE
TIME THE USER EXITS THE CRT PLOT ROUTINES. A different
wavelength set can be selected by entering the upper-case
file-ID-letter and the record number. For example:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>V234</p></td>
</table>

<p>selects file &quot;v&quot;, data set record 234 as the
current wavelength set. You may also assign channel numbers
to the &quot;wavelength set&quot; by typing a &quot;C&quot;
and the number of channels. For example:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>C2314</p></td>
</table>

<p>sets channel 1 to be &quot;wavelength&quot; 1.0, channel
2 to be 2.0, and so on to channel 2314 which is set to
2314.0.</p>

<p>9.7 Graphics Cursor Position</p>

<p>WARNING: the graphics cursor read routine currently only
works with X-windows or HP-compatible graphics terminals.
Often you want to know a particular data value that is
displayed on a plot. The graphics cursor read routine allows
you to place the cursor on a particular data point, press
return, and the closest channel number, wavelength, and data
value are displayed, along with the equivalent wavelength
and data value for the cursor position on the graph. This
position capability also allows you to graphically
interpolate a value if you are trying to estimate a data
value. To begin the graphics cursor read routine, type a</p>

<td width="73%">
<p>G</p></td>
</table>

<p>command (be certain it is upper case g, because lower
case g is the glitch removal routine). Next, use the
graphics cursor arrow keys on the graphics terminal to
position the cursor to the desired location on the CRT plot.
Then press return to get the position displayed. To exit the
cursor position routine, type an</p>

<p>9.8 Interactive Band Analysis The interactive band
analysis routine is a graphically oriented absorption band
analysis system. The user selects continuum points
graphically, the system then removes the continuum, and the
user can select the band center or let the routine find it.
The Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) works similarly. The
routine can write the results in ascii to a user selected
file. WARNING: this routine currently ONLY works with
X-windows or Hewlett-Packard compatible graphics terminals.
The routine is entered from the CRT plot routines by typing
an</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>A</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. The routine then prompts the user for one of
three actions: the changing of the vertical and horizontal
scales, the opening of a new file, or the analysis of a
band. The changing of the plot scales is by a</p>

<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>c</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. The scale change command calls the plot scale
routine, so it proceeds exactly as the normal scale changing
is done in plotting a spectrum (see section 9.3). If the
user wishes to open a new output file for writing the ascii
results of the analysis, type an</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>o</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. You will then be prompted for the file name and
a title for the data which is to be written. The
&quot;automated, interactive band analysis&quot; is started
by issuing an</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>a</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. You are first prompted for the first point
which lies on the continuum which surrounds the band of
interest. After this prompt is given, you are expected to
use the graphics cursor position keys to move the cursor to
the first continuum point and then to enter a return. A box
is then drawn around the nearest channel in the data set
(i.e. the continuum points can be selected by locating their
proper horizontal position alone and ignoring the current
vertical position of the graphics cursor). After the first
point has been selected you are then asked whether this
point is at the right position, if it is not, you may redo
it by typing an</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>r</p></td>
</table>

<p>or you may continue by entering a return. Once you have
selected the first continuum point, the process is then
repeated for the second continuum point. If both points are
correct you enter a return and the data are scaled by
dividing out the continuum and then the continuum-removed
spectrum is plotted. At this point in the analysis you must
determine whether you would like to move the locations of
the continuum points (command &quot;m&quot;), change the
plot scales (command &quot;c&quot;) or have the band center
selected (return). If you decide to do another continuum the
new one is done using the same process by which the original
continuum was selected. The only exception is that the data
for the y axis which is used to select the new continuum is
no longer the original data but is instead the
continuum-removed spectrum currently displayed on the
screen. If you wish to rescale the data, it is done in the
same manner as in the normal spectrum plotting routine. If
you decide that all is correct and the band center should
now be selected, the program begins its analysis with a
return command. The program first searches the
continuum-removed data to find the minimum channel between
the two selected continuum points. Once the minimum point
has been found, a parabola is fit to the minimum point and
the two points nearest to this minimum. The center
wavelength (x-coordinate) of this parabola is then
calculated as well as the reflectance (y-coordinate) on the
parabola at this point. A solid vertical line is then
plotted from this calculated set of coordinates to the
continuum. The reflectance level of the Full Width Half Max
(FWHM) is then calculated and the FWHM is then itself drawn
as a dashed line between the sides of the band with its
endpoints being solid boxes. A vertical dashed line at the
mid-point of the FWHM is then drawn from the reflectance
level of the absorption feature to the continuum. If there
are enough channels (10 channels are currently being used as
the limit) between the two end-points of the FWHM the
routine will draw a cross at the Full Width Quarter Max
(FWQM). This routine repeats this process determining
whether it is possible to find the subsequent full widths
(e.g. Full Width Eighth Max) by examining the number of
channels as determined by the previous full width. The last
full width that can be determined is the Full Width
Sixty-fourth Max. The last FWQM (if present) or subsequent
width which has been located is drawn as a dotted line with
its endpoints being two small solid boxes. The center of
this width is then computed and a vertical dotted line is
draw from its intersection with the data to the continuum.
You are now asked whether you would prefer to use the fit
selected center (return) or to manually select the band
center by an</p>

<tr valign="top" align="left">

<td width="73%">
<p>s</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. If the fit selected center is chosen the FWHM
is calculated, as well as the asymmetry parameter and the
band depth with the band center and FWHM being written to
the terminal. If you choose to manually select the band
center you must manually move the graphics cursor (as
before) to the correct horizontal position. A Full Width
Half Max is then drawn on the graphics screen and is
calculated and then written to the terminal. After the band
center has been selected you have the option to redo the
center with an</p>

<p>command, or to venture forward (return). Next, you have
the option to select the FWHM manually with an</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->

       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>f</p></td>
</table>

<p>command, or to have the width selected automatically. If
manual selection is chosen, a horizontal line is drawn at
the proper reflectance level and you then select two points
on that line in a manner similar to chosing the original
continuum (Note: with noisy data, manual selection may need
to be used). After the FWHM has been determined by either of
the methods above, you are then asked whether the error
associated with the horizontal data should be determined
automatically (return) or picked by the user with an</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>m</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. The automatic error selection finds the first
two points on either side of the channel nearest the band
center and takes their absolute difference divided by four
as the horizontal error value. If you wish to determine the
horizontal error manually, you enter two points in a fashion
similar to the selection of the continuum or the manual
determination of the FWHM. Once the error has been obtained
by either method, you are asked whether the data should be
written to an ascii text file (default). If you choose not
to write the data to a file with an</p>

<td width="73%">
<p>n</p></td>
</table>

<p>command, the routine then asks if you would like to exit
(command e) or begin the entire process again (return). If,
however, you wish to write the data, the program prompts you
for a file and title for the data if a file is not currently
open. You then receive a prompt for a 15 character comment
(longer comments are silently truncated) which describes the
band (you may wish to standardize the content of this field
when analyzing many bands). After a comment has been entered
the program asks you if you want to exit with an</p>

<p>command or to begin the entire process once more.</p>

<p>Known crashes: 1) If one attempts to run the program to
analyze a band with a large number of deleted channels, the
routine seems to get confused and crashes specpr.</p>

channels may be marked as deleted by typing the</p>

<tr valign="top" align="left">

<td width="73%">
<p>c</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. Internal to specpr, the deletion is done by
setting the value of the data in the specified channels to
-1.23&times;1034. Thus, once a data point has been deleted,
its value has been changed and it can&rsquo;t be undeleted.
The list of channel numbers consists of numbers separated by
spaces and by pairs of numbers separated by a &quot;t&quot;
(meaning to or through). For example:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="73%">
<p>r 1 2 55t63 77 117 t 120 c</p></td>
</table>

<p>means to delete channels 1, 2, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60,
61, 62, 63, 77, 117, 118, 119, and 120. If you forget the
&quot;c&quot;, the routine will ask for another line of
deleted points until a c, for complete, continue, is
entered.</p>

<p>from the CRT plot will call the glitch removal routine.
The routine tries to identify glitches by looking for data
points which are greater than 6 percent of the total data
range and, by the use of a simple pattern recognition
routine, checks 4 conditions. The data points which are
thought to be glitches are identified by a small diamond
shaped symbol. The user can then select which data points
are &quot;actual&quot; glitches and can then correct them.
The glitches are assumed to be wrong by some power of 2 from
the true data. This follows from a binary counter where one
of the bits has been set wrong. This routine was written
specifically for the University of Hawaii &quot;Wedge&quot;
CVF spectrometer which has these type of counters, but most
modern digital instruments are similar and this routine may
work for them. WARNING: once the data have been multiplied
or divided, the glitch removal is an estimate of the actual
data and thus strictly speaking, is &quot;fudging&quot; the
data. The user indicates which channels are to be
&quot;deglitched&quot; by selecting all data points marked
on the graph, only those indicated by a list, or all those
selected by the program except for those in a list. By

<p>command, all the channels identified by the program are
glitches BUT those channels which are typed in after the
&quot;b&quot;. At least one space must occur between channel
numbers. The glitch routine searches for 15 glitches at one
time so it may take more than one pass to remove a lot of
glitches. Sometimes more than one bit is wrong, and it will
take more than one pass. Glitches which occur next to each
other are not recoverable by this routine since the routine
tries to correct the point to the surrounding data using the
nearest power of 2. If after 2 passes on the same point the
data value is not restored, it is probably lost. A note on
removing glitches: you are fudging the data. If you are not
very careful and use the utmost restraint, you may create
some absorption or emission features you had not counted
on!</p>

<p>9.11 Information Display and Information Change Every
standard specpr data set contains extensive header
information, including the title, history, dates and times
of data acquisition and data processing, as well as many
others. Appendix A lists the specpr format, and all the
header information values may be displayed and changed in
the Information Change routines. To change header
information, type the</p>

is contained on many pages, the first of which displays the
title. Pressing return goes to the next page, and typing</p>

<p>from any page returns to the first page. To change
information on any page, type the indicated letter. You will
then be instructed to input the appropriate data. In the

<p>and the line number or simply the line number 1, 2, 3,
or 4, or to change all four lines, type &quot;m&quot;and no
line number. In the case of the Band Normalization factor,
scan time, or total integrating time, the number can be
integer, floating point, or scientific notation. In the case
of scientific notation, the number is typed in as an integer
or real number, then the letter e, then the exponent (to the
power of 10, an integer). Thus</p>

<p>will return to the calling routine (Math Operations or
File Display and Transfer). The &quot;e&quot; exit command
will not terminate other processing; it only skips the CRT
plot. Thus, if a file write is pending (as in the Math
Operation, Chapter 8, or file transfer with display, Chapter
10), it will be completed in the type e exit. If you wish to
exit and terminate pending file writes, type</p>

<p>for a hard exit. Note that, from the data display
routine (Chapter 10), no information is changed on the
stored data unless there is a transfer involved (see Chapter
10).</p>

<p>9.12 Printer Listings and Printer Plots The entire
header information and data (in scientific notation) can be
listed on the printer by typing the</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>pd</p></td>
</table>

<p>(print data) command. The data can be plotted as a
printer plot with the current vertical scale by typing</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>p</p></td>
</table>

<p>and the number of copies (10 or less). The data can be
plotted in a printer plot only as a function of channel
number. The vertical-axis resolution is 1 part in 100 (100
print positions for the plot). For each data point printed,
the wavelength, channel number, and data number are given.
Four pages are required for 256 data points and 2 pages for
120 points. When the number of channels is less than 120,
the plot is scaled to fit from 1 to 2 pages.</p>

<p>9.13 Multiple Commands in the CRT Plot Routines One
entire line (80 characters) can be input to the CRT plot
routine at one time for execution. For example, to change
the wavelength data set to file v, record 2, change scale,
print a printer plot, and set the line type to 3, you would
type the</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>V2cpl3</p></td>
</table>

<p>or</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>V2 c p l3</p></td>
</table>

<p>Spaces can be inserted wherever desired but are not
necessary. This multiple command capability greatly speeds
up processing since it may take several seconds to plot the
data on the CRT and would take a long time to replot the CRT
after each command (on a standard graphics terminal;
X-windows is typically only a fraction of a second).</p>

<p>9.14 Exiting the CRT Plot Routines There are 3 commands
for exiting the CRT plot. The normal method of exiting the
CRT plot routines is by typing an</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>e</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. In this case, the user soft exits from the CRT
plot in the normal fashion and the program executes the next
command. The &quot;hard exit&quot;, terminate all pending
commands, is the</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>x</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. With the &quot;x&quot; exit command, specpr
returns to the calling routine (which is either Math
Operations or File Display, Transfer, and Overlay). After a
soft exit (e) from the CRT plot under Math Operations, the
data set is written to the requested location (see section
8.7). If errors are included, the program writes on the CRT
where they will be written and gives the user the option of
not writing the error data set (by typing an</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<td width="73%">
<p>x</p></td>

<p>command). Otherwise, press return or type a</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>c</p></td>
</table>

<p>command to continue. After a soft exit from the CRT plot
under File Display and Transfer, the data set is written
only if there is a transfer (see Chapter 10); otherwise, the
next command is executed. The third way to exit the CRT plot
routines applies to the Math Operations routine only. If the
Band Normalization option was not turned on, the user may
type a</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="73%">
<p>b</p></td>
</table>

<p>command. This will turn on the Band Normalization
option, exit the CRT plot, and go to the Band Normalization
routine (section 8.9). When the Band Normalization routine
is left, the program will return to the CRT plot. If the
&quot;b&quot; command is entered while in the file display,
transfer, and overlay routines, the CRT plot will soft exit
(as a type &quot;e&quot; exit above).</p>
