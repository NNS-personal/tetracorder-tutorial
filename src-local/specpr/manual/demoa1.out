                         Specpr News Notes

12/18/87: New method for reporting specpr bugs.  There is now a
        program called "specpr.bugs".  When you have a bug to report, type
        from a specpr prompt:
                        !specpr.bugs
        The specpr.bugs program will prompt you for a title and a
        message.  When you are through, type a "control d" as the first
        thing on the line and the specpr.bugs will deliver mail to specpr
        and post the message to the notesfile specpr.bugs

8/26/87:  Major additions and bug fixes

	The following special functions have been available in dspecpr for
	some time, but they are now in specpr.

	f43 - fft: fast fourier transform and inverse is working
		fine but frequencies (x-axis values) are wrong for one
		half of the spectrum.

	f44 - suh: Segmented Upper Hull: automatic continuum analysis.

                     Welcome to SPECPR.
This is demo A and its intention is to give a quick introduction
to some of the capabilities of the program.  All "help" messages in
this demo will be enclosed by a string of colons above and some
below as in this message.  These messages will not appear in a
normal running of the program.  These messages are invoked by doing
a unix shell command "more" on a particular file.  On long messages,
a prompt "more" will appear at the bottom of the screen.  Press the
space bar to get the next page of text.

Any command can be executed while within SPECPR by simply typing
"!command" (e.g. !who ).  This feature is used several times in the
demos and is the reason for things such as "!sdelay" and "!sleep 1"
which will appear on your screen in subsequent displays.

::::::::: press space bar to continue demo :::::::::::::::::::::::::

This demo will show the following.
	1) How to initialize a restart file (which must be done each
		time SPECPR is run from a new directory).  In demo B
		we will demonstrate how SPECPR is normally run once
		a restart file has been established.
	2) How to list data files.
	3) How to plot spectra on the graphics terminal.
	4) Overlay spectra covering different wavelength ranges
		(e.g. a visible-NIR and a MIR spectrum).
	5) How to copy (called "transfer") spectra from one data
		file to another.
	6) A sample math problem will be shown: derive a continuum
		to a kaolinite spectrum and remove it by division.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
In the initial running of this  program from a new directory a
restart file (and .spttl .cmd files) must be created. By convention 
the restart file is typically named "r1".  We chose a simple name
purely for the reason that we could always recognize what that file
was.

In this demo the procedure to establish a restart file is initiated
by entering "u r1" in response to a question asked in the beginning
of the program.

Other rather self-explanatory questions are asked.  More detail can
be found in section 4 of the SPECPR users manual.

We have just completed part of the initialization process. Now we
must assign the files w,v,d,u,y so that data can be accessed. In
this demo we initially assign v to the file named "spdemos" which
contains some sample data which will be used later.

THE NAME GIVEN TO EACH LETTER IS VERY IMPORTANT.  The name is used
in all histories which are automatically generated by any math
operation.  It is important that the names make sense so that you
will be able to trace your processing steps, if needed, sometime in
the future.  The convention is to name the data file the same as
the name of the magnetic tape on which you will archive the results.
The SPECPR convention is to NEVER reuse a tape name.  That way any
spectral ID is guaranteed to be unique.

"v" has now been assigned to the file spdemos and has been given the
name "spdemos" as can be seen at the top of the screen.  We are
currently in the main "menu" of SPECPR (section 7 of the SPECPR
users manual).

Next we will enter the section of the program
called file transfer and display and demonstrate a few of the

Next a sample spectrum is displayed.  The command to do this is
	v43V36al3
A spectrum is accessed by its letter code and record number.  The
letter code can be lower or upper case.  Lower case means vertical
axis and upper case refers to the horizontal axis.  The vertical
axis must always come first.  So the above command means display
record v43 using the record V36 for the wavelength (x-axis).  Note
that v36 and V36 refer to the same set of data contained in record
v36 but when a V is used this specifies that the particular record
is to be used for the "wavelength set".
Following the request for the data are options on how to modify the
default conditions. The "a" in the command designates that you want 
to plot in wavelength space, other options are h for channel and n 
for "inverse wavelength".
::::::::: press space bar to continue demo :::::::::::::::::::::::::

Note the letter is the second one of the words wavelength, channel, 
and inverse.  These options can be seen at the bottom of the plot
which will soon appear.  This option need not be specified each 
time a spectrum is plotted with the plot remaining in the last x 
coordinate space that was selected.  Finally the "l3" at the end 
of the command selects the specific type of line (dotted ,
dashed , solid ...) with which the plot is to be made.  The line 
type is set properly for HP class of graphics terminals but may 
not exist on other types.
The scale of the plot is then changed once an initial display has
been generated using the command c; w .2 3 ; 0 1.  The c stands for
change scale as denoted on the top of the plot display.  A ";" is
shorthand for a return.  The "w .2 3" means wavelength from 0.2 to
3.0 units (default is microns) and the "0 1" sets the vertical scale
from 0 to 1.0.

 Current Scale: VERTICAL= 0.0000E+00   2.0000E+00
                HORIZ.  = Automatic

 To scale the plot, type in the mode (n or w) and horizontal axis limits first.
 When the vertical scale is entered, the routine will exit to the plot.

 HORIZONTAL:
 type  n  and left and right hand limits for INVERSE WAVELENGTH, or:
 type  w  and left and right hand WAVELENGTH limits
          (if you type  w  only,  the program will AUTOSCALE the limits 
          from the current wavelength set)

 VERTICAL:
 Type lower bound and upper bound values for the VERTICAL AXIS, or:
 type  A  to AUTO SCALE (the VERTICAL AXIS), or:

           Now we will change the scale of the plot.

Following the instructions shown above we type:

	w .2 3

to change the wavelength scale to .2 microns to 3 microns.  Then:

	0 1

to change the vertical scale to 0 to 1.

      Now we will overlay 2 separate spectra on the same plot.

We will display the spectrum of Olivine from .2 to 20 microns.  The
command used in this instance is:

	v16V9l7o v34V23l3o

The explanation for the mess is as follows v16 is displayed using
the wavelength set V9.  The small o indicates that overlay mode.  
The "l7" indicates line type 7.

Then spectrum v34 is to be plotted with wavelength set V23 using
line type 3 (l3) and it is also in overlay mode (the o is needed on
EVERY spectrum to be overlayed, even the last one).

Once the routine is entered we again change the scale of the plot
using a command c;w .2 20 where the ";" represents a carriage return
in SPECPR.
