NAME
     spfeatures - search spectral features data base

SYNOPSIS
     spfeatures [-c range] [-w range] [-d range] [-e range]
		[-a range] [-F file] [-o file] [-h] [-v] [-b]


DESCRIPTION
     This program searches the spectral features database selecting
entries based on the band center, width, depth, asymmetry, or error on the
depth of the feature.  All numbers refer to microns in the database.

     Options:

	    -c c1 c2 : Band Center --  Causes program to select
			 all features with a band center within
			 the bounds of c1 and c2.   c2 must be
			 greater than or equal to c1.

	    -w w1 w2 : Band Width --  Causes program to select
			 all features with a band width within
			 the bounds of w1 and w2.  w2 must be
			 greater than or equal to w1.

	    -d d1 d2 : Band Depth --  Causes program to select
			 all features with a band depth within
			 the bounds of d1 and d2.   d2 must be
			 greater than or equal to d1.

	    -e e1 e2 : Error on band depth --  Causes program 
			to select all features with an error
			on the band depth that is within the
			bounds of e1 and e2.   e2 must be
			greater than or equal to e1.

	    -a a1 a2 : Band Asymmetry --  Causes program to
	 		select all features with a band asymmetry
			within the bounds of a1 and a2.  a2
			must be greater than or equal to a1.

            -F file  : Database file --  Causes program to use
			"file" as a database, rather than the
			default file.

	    -o file  : Output file -- Causes output to be written
			to "file", rather than standard output.
			"File" is outputted in binary form, and
			is not compatible with the "-b" option.
				(-h and -v are ignored)

	    -h       : Header -- Causes the appropriate header
			to be included in the output.
				(default is no header)

	    -v       : Verbose -- Prints the entire title and the
			comments to each band.  (default is a
			seventeen character name, and no comments)

	    -b       : Bandanal format -- Causes program to use
			the output from Specpr Interactive Band
			Analysis routine, see section 9.8 of the specpr
			manual.  This option is not compatible with the
			-o option, and causes a fatal error.  (-v is
			ignored, and -h header is changed)



     When more than one option is given, the search is by "and" as
compared to an "or" search.  If an "or" search is desired, run the
program separately, and append the output to a file.

EXAMPLES

Find all features with a center between 1.38 and 1.41 microns:

       spfeatures -c 1.38 1.41

Find all features between 1.38 and 1.41 microns with a full width at
half maximum less than 0.01 micron:

       spfeatures -c 1.38 1.41 -w 0 0.01

Find all features between 1.38 and 1.41 microns with full width at
half maximum less than 0.01 micron, and belonging to Alunite:

       spfeatures -c 1.38 1.41 -w 0 0.01 | grep Alunite

Find all features between 1.38 and 1.41 microns with full width at
half maximum greater than 0.01 micron, and all features between 2.1 
and 2.4 microns that belong to Alunite, and put the output in a file
called temp1 with a header:

       spfeatures -h -c 1.38 1.41 -w 0.01 9999 | grep Alunite > temp1
       spfeatures -c 2.1 2.4 | grep Alunite >> temp1


FILES
     /d1/samples/features/FWHM_46      binary features database
     /d1/samples/features/FWHM         bandanl features database
     *                                 user's features database
     NOTE: the above files are be site dependent.

NOTES
    1) There will be no output if there are no options (null default).
