F40:  Least Squares Between Two Spectra                 Alias = leastsq
This function computes the least squares between two spectra.  You enter two
data sets and the routine computes the sum of the squared differences between
the two spectra.

It is
currently under development and should not be used.  See your site
specpr manager if you need this routine.
