NAME
     oldsptoascii - convert a specpr version 1 format file on a DEC
                    VAX to ascii data

SYNOPSIS
     oldsptoascii file

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts a specpr version 1 file to ascii so that it
may be easily transferred to a different machine (or the same machine)
and retranslated to the local machine format, thus avoiding the writing
of special floating point number conversion routines.

     This program MUST be compiled and run on a VAX Unix (or VAX
Eunice) system.

     The output is written to standard out, which may be redirected
to another file.

FILES
     "file"       user-specified specpr file
