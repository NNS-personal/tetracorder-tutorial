<p>HTML-IMAGE.nr 0C 0 HTML-IMAGE-END.lf 1 - HTML-IMAGE.nr
0C 0 HTML-IMAGE-END.ce SPECPR User Communication</p>

<p>All user input is to the integer array IOPCON
dimensioned 80 in /LBL4/ common. The I/O is by a read
statement with an 80A1 format. All numbers and characters
are decoded from this array.</p>

<p>The actual decoding is perfomed by the subroutine WJFREN
(for wedge free input routine). The call is: CALL WJFREN (I,
X, IL) where I is the column number pointer (array index
value) in IOPCON (1 to 80), X is a real number returned, and
IL is a letter or character returned. I is intitially set
before the first call (usually to 1, the beginning of the
line) and then WJFREN updates the pointer. If a number is
encountered, X is set to that number, if a character is
encountered the character is returned in IL. If a number and
a character are back-to-back (no spaces) then both the
number and the character are returned in X and IL,
respectively by one call to WJFREN. If a number is followed
by a space and then a character, the first call to WJFREN
returns the number in X and sets IL to an integer zero then
the second call will return the character (with X set to
zero). Thus number inputs are essentially automatically
checked for illegal characters (positive numbers do not
require a plus sign - plus signs are returned as
characters). If a negative sign is followed by a blank or a
character it is returned as character (thus a negative sign
followed by a blank then a number will not be returned as a
negative number).</p>

<p>The following is an example of how SPECPR might decode 2
numbers. Also, if the user types an E or X, the program
exits.</p>
<pre>         SUBROUTINE TEST (TEST1, TEST2)
         DATA IHE,IHX /1HE, 1HX/

1        CALL CRTIN                    User input.
         I=1                           start scan at column 1.
         CALL WJFREN (I, X, IL)
         IF (I. LT. 80) GO to 10       If &ge; 80, no input.

9        CALL WHAT (I)                 flag error.
         GO TO 1                       start over.

10       IF ((IL. EQ. IHE).            exist of requested.
        1OR. (IL. EQ. IHX))
        2RETURN
         IF (IL. NE. 0)                error:  character
        1GO TO 9                       encountered.
         TEST1=X                      First number.
         CALL WJFREN (I,X,IL)          Get second number.
         IF (I. GE. 80) GO TO 9        no second number.
         IF (IL. NE. 0) GO TO 9        error:  character
                                       encountered.
         TEST2=X                      second number.
         RETURN
         END
</pre>

<p>Subroutine WHAT writes a question mark on the terminal
and a carrot (^) sign at the value of I which is indicative
of where the error occured. If no characters were input
(I&ge;80), no carrot sign is printed and a question mark is
printed in column 1.</p>

<p>This is a lot more work than just a FORTRAN read
statement, but the input is totally checked for errors, the
range of the numbers (if they have limits or conditions) can
be checked and flaged and characters can be input on the
same line for other controls (either mixed with the number
or in place of numbers). This allows for maximum flexibility
for the user to control the program with a minimum of typing
and reading and answering question.</p>

<p align=center>SPECPR Spectral Data File I/O</p>

<p>The following pages show code examples for reading and
writing specpr data records involving spectra and the header
to the data.</p>

<p>All file status and control parameters are stored in 5
common blocks. User communication (CRT I/O) needs the /LBL4/
common block (132 words).</p>

<p>To read a spectrum from the disc or tape files you must
write a prompting message and then the 9 FORTRAN statements
given on the next pages. If you want to give the user the
soft or hard exit option (type E or X) you must test the
variable: ID for equaling a Hollerith E or X after the
WJFREN call (statement 3). This is done in SPECPR using a
data statement:</p>

<p>DATA IHE, IHX /1HE, 1HX/</p>

<p>Then test ID after the WJFREN call:</p>
<pre>IF (ID. EQ. IHE) GO TO   <img src="grohtml-15697-1.png"> &larr; go to soft exit
IF (ID. EQ. IHX) GO TO   <img src="grohtml-15697-2.png"> &larr; go to hard exit
</pre>

<p>All control of tapes, I/O error checking, error
messages, protection and file pointer update are performed
by REDFIL.</p>

<p>To write a spectrum data record to disc or tape you can
follow the 11 FORTRAN statements given on the following
pages (a prompting message is also needed) or you can call
the subroutine MTHWRT which is used by the math routines to
decode where the user wants to write the data. This routine
does all the prompting and user input error handling. This
latter method only requires 2 lines of FORTRAN to write the
results. All file control and updates are performed by these
routines as similar to that done in reading a file.</p>

<p>DEVLUN</p>

<p>After decoding a file ID letter and record number, find
the logical unit number by calling</p>

<p>DEVLUN (I, IDLETR, LUN)</p>

<p>where the file letter ID Logical unit number of the
device which devices are valid:</p>

<p>= 0 : all units (V, W, D, U, Y, and S)</p>

<p>= 4 : all but S</p>

<p>for normal Math Operations and Special Functions the
variable I is 4. The variables I and IDLETR do not have to
be variables in the calling program</p>

<p>e.g. CALL DEVLUN (4, 1HV, LUN)</p>

<p>Note: LUN must be a variable.</p>

<p>DEVSTA</p>

<p>After the file logical unit number has been found, the
device status must be checked (e.g. not assigned, etc.). The
call is</p>

<p>CALL DEVSTA (LUN, ISTA, I, IPRT)</p>

<p>where logical unit number returned status condition:</p>

<p>device online, record pointer to the value of ISTA</p>

<p>assigned to &quot;/dev/null&quot;</p>

<p>illegal device (not LUN of V, U, D, W, Y, or S)</p>

<p>= 0 : return without printing</p>

<p>= 1 : print message reflecting above status</p>

<p>Device Protection</p>

<p>read/write anywhere. (no protection)</p>

<p>protected. Read up to protection number, write only to
protection number +1.</p>

<p>read-only device. (up to absolute value of the
protection number).</p>

<p>The variable ISTA and IPRT must be variables in the
calling program.</p>

<p>After the routines DEVLUN and DEVSTA have been called,
check the value of ISTA to be sure it is greater than zero
and the file number being accessed is allowed by the
protection (IPRT).</p>

<p align=center>Subroutine RSTART (IC)</p>

<p>RSTART sets up the SPECPR files and protections for
restarting the program at the same condition as when SPECPR
was last terminated (from Program Operations).</p>

<p>Store the current parameters for a future restart.</p>

<p>Restart: Recall the parameters and assign and open all
the files and devices.</p>

<p>Restart: Recall the parameters but don&rsquo;t assign
and open any files. If 32 is added to the above the the
arrays dataa, datac and error are not saved or restored</p>
