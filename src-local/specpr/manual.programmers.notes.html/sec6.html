<p>0. Introduction</p>

<p>The Gould may be used to produce alphanumeric symbols,
curves, or pictures by laying down a pattern of closely
spaced &quot;dots.&quot; The density of these is 200/inch or
approximately 78.74/cm. The paper is 11 inches wide and of
arbitrary length.</p>

<p>A set of fortran callable subroutines has been written
to provide a simple means for utilizing the Gould as a
plotting device. Since the Gould can move the paper only in
one direction it is necessary to create intermediate data
files on disk containing a representation of the plot to
allow for drawing the parts of the plot in any order. The
representation chosen was to represent each line of data as
it is actually sent to the Gould, with a zero bit meaning a
white dot, and a one bit meaning a black dot. Although this
requires a rather large file (
<img src="grohtml-15775-1.png"> words/inch of vertical space
on the Gould), it permitted a more straightforward and rapid
implementation than with other schemes.</p>

<p>In order to produce a plot, using these subroutines,
four main steps are involved. They are:</p>
<pre>1.  Prepare the disk file.
2.  Initialize the origin and scale factors.
3.  Plot the data, titles, axes, etc. to the file.
4.  Dump the file to the plotter.
</pre>

<p>1. Preparing the File</p>

<p>A subroutine named SETUP must be called first before any
others in the plot collection. Its function is to setup the
vector and text intermediate disk files. SETUP also
calculates the value of several parameters which are
required for the proper functioning of the other
subroutines. These parameters are stored in common areas
named PLOT01 and PLOT02, which should be separate from the
named common in the user&rsquo;s routines.</p>

<p>The arguments to SETUP are as follows: The logical unit
number to which status and error messages are to be sent.
The id under which the disk file is to be assigned. The
disposition (2 characters) The maximum vertical dimension of
the plot (in cm.), up to 200 cm. The maximum horizontal
dimension of the plot (in cm.) up to 27 cm. error status</p>

<p>Initially the disposition is &quot;NE&quot; for new or
&quot;RE&quot; for replace. Subsequently it may be
&quot;OL&quot; for a file which already exists and which is
to be re-plotted.</p>
<pre>Ex:  CALL SETUP (6, &rsquo;X&rsquo;, &rsquo;PLDATA&rsquo;, &rsquo;RE&rsquo;, 20.6, 27.0, IER)
</pre>

<p>2. Scaling the Data</p>

<p>After SETUP has been called, a centimeter coordinate
system is automatically established with the upper left
corner of the paper being (0., 0.) and the horizontal and
vertical limits being the values given as the last two
arguments to SETUP. The positive directions are to the right
and downwards respectively.</p>

<p>In general the user&rsquo;s data values are not in
centimeters and rather than having to convert them, a
subroutine named RANGE has been provided to do the job. Its
arguments are the centimeter coordinates of two arbitrary
points on the user&rsquo;s plot and the corresponding data
values. Figure 6.1 should make this clear:</p>

<p>Two arbitrary points are chosen (labeled
<img src="grohtml-15775-2.png"> and
<img src="grohtml-15775-3.png"> ) and their values are given
as the following arguments to RANGE: The data value of
<img src="grohtml-15775-4.png"> in the vertical direction.
(shown as <img src="grohtml-15775-5.png"> ) The data value
of <img src="grohtml-15775-6.png"> in the horizontal
direction (shown as <img src="grohtml-15775-7.png"> ) The
centimeter coordinate of <img src="grohtml-15775-8.png"> in
the vertical direction (shown as
<i><img src="grohtml-15775-9.png"></i> ) The centimeter
coordinate of <img src="grohtml-15775-10.png"> in the
horizontal direction (shown as
<img src="grohtml-15775-11.png"> ) Same as dndt1 but for
<img src="grohtml-15775-12.png"> Same as acdt1 but for
<img src="grohtml-15775-13.png"> Same as dncm1 but for
<img src="grohtml-15775-14.png"> Same as accm1 but for
<img src="grohtml-15775-15.png"></p>

<p>The only restriction is that

<img src="grohtml-15775-17.png"> .</p>
<pre>Ex:  CALL RANGE (X(1), Y(1), 2., 1.5, X(N), Y(N), 20.1, 26.5)
</pre>

<p>3. Generating the Pattern</p>

<p>The subroutines described in this section set the
appropriate bits in the disk file to represent points,
curves, and characters. Curves are composed of lne segments
between the successive points. Most of the subroutines have
an integer argument by which the user can choose the
thickness of lines and the height of characters. A
convention has been adopted such that if this integer is
negative then the other arguments which give the position of
the line or character, are in centimeters rather than in
data units. This is convenient for referring to places on
the outlying regions of the plot.</p>

<p>a. Points and Lines</p>

<p>Subroutine POINT permits the placement of a single point
or a square matrix of points. Its arguments are: The
vertical coordinate of the upper left corner. The horizontal
coordinate of the upper left corner. The length of a side in
Gould units (1 Gould unit = .005 in.).</p>
<pre>e.g.:
        CALL POINT (5., 4., -4)
        CALL POINT (X, Y, 1)

Subroutine LINE may be used to draw lines or rectangles at any
angle.  Its arguments are:

The vertical coordinate of one end of the line.
The horizontal coordinate of one end of the line.
The vertical coordinate of the other end of the line.
The horizontal coordinate of the other end of the line.
The thickness of the line in Gould units.
e.g.:
        CALL LINE (X(I), Y(I), X(I+1), Y(I+1), 1)
        CALL LINE (2., 1., 1.5, 4., -5)
</pre>

<p>b. Characters</p>

<p>Two subroutines are available-for plotting single
symbols or strings of text.</p>

<p>Subroutine PLTSYM is used to mark one&rsquo;s data
points on the plot with &quot;centered&quot; symbols. Its
arguments are:</p>

<p>The vertical coordinate of the center of the symbol. The
horizontal coordinate of the center of the symbol. The size
of the symbol as a multiple of 8 Gould units. The symbol
number is chosen from figure 6.2.</p>

<p>Subroutine SYMBOL is used to write text to the plot
file. Its arguments are:</p>

<p>The vertical coordinate of the lower left corner of the
first character. The horizontal coordinate of the lower left
corner of the first character. The height of the characters
as a multiple of 10 Could units. The array of characters to
be plotted. The angle (in degrees) at which they are to be
plotted with 0&deg; being vertical and 90&deg; being
horizontal. The number of characters in string to be
plotted.</p>

<p>e.g.: CALL SYMBOL (2.5, 1.5, -1, 16HThis is a Sample,
60., 16)</p>

<p>Subroutine SYMBOL recognizes six special characters
which can occur in the text array passed to it (the 4th
argument). These are:</p>

</pre>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>HTML-IMAGE-END As it was assumed that these characters
would not need to be printed they have been reserved for the
above special use. Backslash can be used to cause characters
to be overprinted. At-sign terminates the last use of a
brace. All characters in between are printed in script
mode.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>c. Axes</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>We consider an axis to be a horizontal or vertical line
between two points, having a sequence of short line segments
at right angles. These segments, called tic-marks, may have
the value of the varying coordinate indicated above or below
them, and a title can be written above or below the axis. It
is possible for the user to write his own axis drawing
routine using only the LINE and SYMBOL subroutines, but it
would be inconvenient to determine the exact location of the
tic-marks and their values. It is easier to use the AXIS
subroutine, however one must accept the conventions which
were adopted. The arguments to AXIS and the conventions are
as follows:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>The vertical coordinate of one end of the axis, in data
units. The horizontal coordinate of one end of the axis, in
data units. The vertical coordinate of the other end of the
axis, in data units. The horizontal coordinate of the other
end of the axis, in data units. An array of characters for
the title. The number of characters in wlabel. If zero then
no title or tic-mark labeling will be drawn. The minimum
spacing of the tic-marks in cm.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>For a horizontal axis, dn1 = dn2 while for a vertical
axis, acr1 = acr2. The tic marks will be drawn from the axis
to the direction of the center of the plot, and will be
either 36 or l8 Gould units in length, the longer one being
used for labeled tic-marks and the shorter one for unlabeled
tic-marks. Tic-marks will be drawn only at intervals which
are 1, 2, or 5 times a power of 10, for example .02, 50,
<img src="grohtml-15775-18.png"> etc. and no closer together
than as indicated by step. Two significant digits will be
used with the power of 10 by which the value is to be
multiplied indicated as a superscript after the axis title.
The title will be centered within the axis and will be drawn
at 90 or at 0 degrees. All characters will be 30 Gould units
high.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>e.g.: CALL AXIS (-.2, 1., -.2, 11., 8HX - AXIS, 8,
1.)</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>4. Dumping the Plot File to the Gould</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>Once the plot file has been filled with the picture to be
drawn it must be sent to the Gould. Subroutine DONE closes
the text and vector intermediate files. The program
PLOTDAEMON reformats the text and vector files into the
binary image of the plot which it then sends to the Gould
plotter. The arguments of subroutine DONE are:</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>A dummy argument. No longer used.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
