c           Si = internal reflection
c           aD = absoprtion coefficient * grain diameter

c          wav = wavelength in microns

c    
c     computed:
c           Qs = scattering efficiency
c           Qa = absorption efficiency
c           Qe = extinction efficiency
c       wsingl = singlescattering albedo
c
c                note: Se,Si,r1 are >= 0.0 and <= 1.0.
c
c          Qs1 = Qs - Se which is the single scattering
c                             albedo for first order scattering

c                             reflection from grain surfaces.
c           Qs = the single scattering albedo in Hapke 1981
c                    and assumed Qe = 1.0
c
c                BUT now we do more rigorous:
c
c     more rigorous is 
c
c               Qs = Qe - Qa,  Qe = Qs + Qa
c
c               wsingl = Qs/Qe = Qs/(Qs + Qa) - 1/(1+Qa/Qs)
c
c               Qs = Qd + Qs' = diffraction component + geometric component.
c
c               Previously (pre 2009) we assumed Qd =0
c               Now add Qd =0 when particles touching, growing to 1 when
c               particles separated by a wavelength.
c
c               XX = Hakpe's X parameter = pi * D / wav   (D. wav in same units)
c
c               irregular particles widely separated: Qe = 2 with diffraction.
c
c               distance between particles: Hapke 1993, eqn 10.58, p280
c                    mass of one particle: 4/3 pi r^3 rho
c                                       rho = density.
c                    pv = particles/volume = mx *p/(4/3 pi r^3) 
c                                          = 12 mx *p/(pi D^3) 
c                         mx = mass fraction, p packing density.
c                    dp = distance between particles = (1/pv)^(1/3)
c
c     first compute how much diffraction to add,
c        df = diffraction factor, 0 to 1
c     NOTE: this should be computed outside this routine and passed
c           for increased speed.

      df = dp/D 

      XX = 3.14159265 * D / (wav / 10000.)
      xfact = 3(n-1)XX

c
c     Qs = Qd + Qs'  after Hapke 1993, p94 last line and eq 5.25 p87
c
      if ( df .gt. xfact) then
	Qd = 1.0
      else
	Qd = xfact/df
      endif

c
c According to Hapke (1981 and 1993), for particles touching, Qe=1 and
c there is no diffraction component.  But for small abundance particles,
c in a larger matrix, they are separated enough so that diffraction
c is a factot.  So add the diffraction component back in when
c the average particle spacing is greater than 1 wavelength.  If
c less than 1 wavelength, then decrease the diffraction component
c proportionally.
c
c remember dp is in centimeters, wav in microns, so the 10,000 factor
c

	dpw = (dp/10000.0)/wav
	if (dpw < 1.0) then
		Qd = Qd * dpw
	endif
	
c now if particles are really small:
c
c     note: the Qs below has Qd included, so we don't have the
c           above Qd modifications.  Must resolve this in the future.
c           Until then, this code is limited over what will be valid (see Hapke).
