TO INSTALL
=============================================================

make 
make install

Unless changed the psplotdaemon program will be installed in 
/usr/local/bin

=============================================================
TO USE psplotdaemon
=============================================================

   cat inputfile | psplotdaemon [-c] > outputfile.ps

All input and output is done via stdin and stdout respectively.

The INPUT is expected to be an ascii specpr which includes the
information such as the specpr vector and text plot files.
Example content:
	V/usr/spool/gplot/p0N141930996v
	T/usr/spool/gplot/p0N141930996t
	R/usr/spool/gplot/aa0N141930996
	R/usr/spool/gplot/p0N141930996v
	R/usr/spool/gplot/p0N141930996t
	C   1

The resulting postscript OUTPUT is always directed to stdout.

Example1:

	cat aa0N141930996 | psplotdaemon > output.ps

	This creates Postscript 2 output to output.ps
	with the graph line consisting of a line between
	any two points.

Example2:

	cat aa0N141930996 | psplotdaemon -c > output.ps

	This creates PostScript 2 output to output.ps
	with the graph line consisting of a series of
	Bezieir cubic curves with each curve consisting
	of 3 points and the last ending point (4 total).

LOGS
===========================================================

Unless psdaemon.h logfile is changed, errors are logged to
/usr/log/psplotdaemon.  It is suggested that /usr/log be a link
to the appropriate log directora.  For Example: /var/log on Linux
or /var/adm on HPUX or a subdirectory under that like: 

	HPUX: /usr/log -> /var/adm/splog
