First install specpr


Tetracorder can log runs it makes.  If you would like
this, then:

	cp logtetracorder /usr/local/bin
	cp /dev/null  /usr/log/tetracorder
        chmod 666 /usr/log/tetracorder

        Note, on some systems, it might be /var/log.
        It would be easiest to make a symbolic link,
        otherwise the scripts will need to be changed to
        point to/var/log

Tetracorder can limit who is able to run tetracorder.
If you would like this, then:

        Create a list of users (as given by the "who" command)
        in:

               /usr/local/etc/authtetracorder.list

       then:

               cp authtetracorder /usr/local/bin
               chmod 777 /usr/local/bin/authtetracorder

Tetracorder can tell the answer in a voice in single spectrum mode.
If you want to enable this:

		cp tricordersound /usr/local/bin

        Then customize /usr/local/bin/tricordersound to work in your local
        environment.

Now make tetracorder:

	make
	make install
	cp /usr/local/bin/tetracorder4.4 /usr/local/bin/tetracorder

DONE!
