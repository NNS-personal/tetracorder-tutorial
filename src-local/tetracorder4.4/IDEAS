in spectral feature setup:

    Ignore spectrasl regions, e.g. CO2 bands in a 2-micron ice band

    better:
    If a feature is detected, ignore a set of features.
       If sharp 2-um CO2 band detected, ignore the CO2 triplet.

beyond tetracorder 4.2:

ability to do band ratios as both an independant algorothm
as within a feature fit.  also, ratios of slopes.
also intensities inside a feature, not just the conininuaa.

New ideas for tricorder to be implimented in tricorder 3.0:
Roger Clark

================================================================
Before the library setup, set a flag to enable cube processing.
If the flag is not set, then cube output files are ignored,
and you can run the setup in the same directory as a cube analysis
and analyze individual spectra.
================================================================
case stuff

At the end of each commandlet, have an action command:

action: none         \# do nothing
action: case 1       \# do case 1
action: case 1 4 5   \# do case 1 then 4 then 5

(there is no case 0)

cases are like groups, but are not done until a certain match
is found first.  

see examples in the group description below.
COMPLETE in tricorder 3.0 12/20/94
          except, cases can't yet call other cases
================================================================
Groups are all done.  Group 0 is applied to all groups.
(Meaning group 1 comparisons are group 0 + 1)

COMPLETE in tricorder 3.0 12/20/94
================================================================
after the convolve statement

preratio: URATIO [splib04] 496 RRATIO [splib04] 496

where URATIO = unknown   spectrum / spectrum [splib04] 496
      RRATIO = reference spectrum / spectrum [splib04] 496


Typical uses:

group 0: green vegetation, dry veg, water, ice/snow, melting snow, clouds
             (cloud shadows?)
group 1: minerals/materials in 0.4 to ~1.2um
         (mostly electronic bands)
group 2: minerals/materials in 2-2.5 um region with support from 1-1.5um
         (mostly vibrational bands)
case 1: vegetation species (from veg, group 0)
case 2: vegetation stress (from veg, group 0)
group 3: any level vegetation chlorophyll detection
            (group 3 -0)
case 3:  red-edge shift from group 3

A special flag "-0" can be added after the group # to not include group
0 in the analysis.  (Note all entries in the group should be treated the
same, or bizzare results might be encountered.)  Example:

group 4 -0 URATIO [splib04] 496 RRATIO [splib04] 496

MOSTLY COMPLETE in tricorder 3.0 12/20/94
                you can do a URATIO, or an RATIO, but can't
                yet do both. (trivial to add both: 20 minutes work)
================================================================
The udata specifier specifies on what data to analyze:
          (udata is the unknown, e.g. spectra from the cube)

udata: reflectance     # operate on reflectance data (#2)
udata: emittance       # operate on emittance data (#3)
udata: radiance        # operate on radiance data (#1)
udata: raw             # operate on raw data (#0)

the following are valid only in cases:

udata: previous answer library spectrum             # (#5)
udata: continuum removed previous answer            # (#6)
udata: reversed continuum removed previous answer   # (#7)
           (this one makes the reference the unknown, the unknown spectrum,
            the reference library spectrum, and substitutes the
            continuum removed values)

The observed data set will later be specified what type it is in.
The udata specifier says what it should be converted to before this
analysis is done or used for this analysis.

The idea here is that in the future, we only store one data type (e.g.
the AVIRIS radiance data) and compute what we need on the fly.  The
specification of how to convert is specified elsewhere (in the section
where the cube is assigned).

For example, if the input data were in radiance, and the analysis
should be done in reflectance, then convert the data to reflectance
first.  At Tricorder 3.0, this will be informational only.  A future
version will have conversions added.  For example, the radiance to
reflectance will do an ATREM correction followed by an offset and
multiplier ground calibration.

This feature allows us to do atmospheric analyses on radiance data and
surface reflectance analysis at the same time!  For example, one group
could be atmospheric analysis, the others surface reflectance.  In the
future when we have thermal data in the same cube, coregistered, yet
another group could be analyzing emittance.

Currently, reflectance and emittance are the same.  (With the Mars
Surveyor TES instrument, a calibration to emittance could be applied.)

The raw specifier means don't do anything to the data.

The alternate modes for cases say take the various previous answers and use
one of them.
 e.g.:             in a special case, use the continuum removed spectral
		   feature for additional analysis.  It could be done
		   with vegetation stress on the chlorophyll absorption
		   band.  The continuum removed band can be normalized
		   to a referenced depth (using the reversed mode
		   option) and then the red edge shift can be calibrated
		   in nanometers.  If you didn't do this, the derived
		   shift would be depth dependent.

================================================================
When a group/case is complete, the answer is put into a holding
array (the original spectrum, pointer to the the continuum removed
reference spectra which is the answer, the band depths, fits, etc)
================================================================
the convolve specifier tells whether or not to convolve the
             input reference spectrum to the resolution and sampling
             of the flight instrument

With this feature, we can convolve the reference spectra on the fly and
we don't have to generate separate spectral libraries for each data set.
(Of course, when comparing spectra, we will need the convolved ones, so
maybe this really won't help.)

convolve: no     # don't convolve (flag=0, =1 convolve with gaussians)
convolve: BKMN1X: gaussian wav= [splib04] 12 res= [splib04] 14
convolve: AVIRIS: gaussian wav= [splib04] 12 res= [splib04] 14

The string after convolve specifies alternate data sets.

where the wav= specifies the specpr file and record for the
               reference spectrum input wavelengths
          res= specifies the specpr file and record for the
               reference spectrum input resolution
          gaussian specifies do a gaussian convolution

The tricorder setup will now ask for the resolution as well as
    the wavelengths of the data that are being analyzed.

================================================================

Preprocess specifier allows various algorithms to be applied to the data
before the main algorithm (specified below).

e.g.:
preprocess: linunmix case 6     # linear unmixing case 6
preprocess: lminimize case 7    # linear unmix with band depths
                                  (clark's new algorithm, specified
                                  in case 7)

The case specifies the algorithm and how it should be applied.

================================================================
The algorithm specifier:
After the preprocess designation, the method of analysis is specified:

algorithm: tricorder-primary          # the band fitting routines
algorithm: reversed tricorder-primary # the band fitting routines
                                       (here the library reference and the
                                        unknown spectra are reversed.)
                                        This would mainly be used in special
                                        applications.
algorithm: canopychem  # canopy chemistry
algorithm: linunmix    # linear unmixing (e.g. John Adams)
algorithm: bandratio   # band ratioing
algorithm: lminimize   # linear unmixing to minimize an absorption feature

The linear unmixing algorithms must be able to access answers from other
algorithms like the tricorder-primary.  How this will be done can be
specified by the udata specifier (see above).

Generally, the tricorder-primary would be used in all the groups, then the
other algorithms used in cases.

For example, when you find a lot of veg, do a case and determine
canopy chemistry.

This has the potential for very complex analysis.  For example, determine
there is veg in the pixel, apply a software defoliant, then do an
analysis on the veg removed spectra.  (Need to be careful about infinite
loops here.)

a linear unmixing algorithm might call on answers from groups 0, 1, 2, 3,
and case 3.  all groups are processed first, then cases in their numerical
order.  So if this is case 4, then answers exist from groups 0, 1, 2, 3 and
case 1, 2, and 3.

At tricorder 3.0, only tricorder-primary will be implimented; others will follow.
================================================================
predefine the paths for group1, group2, etc.

all group 0 identifications (done in conjunction with each group 1,
2, ...) are put in with the path with the group currently being
identified.  For example, if material A is group 0, and group 2
materials are being analyzed, if A is found, then the output is in
the directory of group 2 materials.

Implications: if group 0 material has further action, then must set
a flag so it is not done twice?
================================================================
history:
          add specpr file names for v, w, u, d, and y as comments in the
          history file.
================================================================
Cube assignment:  allow from command line so doesn't have to be
                  assigned in specpr

                  DONE in tricorder 2.4
================================================================
Output file bits/pixel and scale, compression, and what to save.

bits   DN # = #
 8     DN 255   = 0.5       #  8 bit output
16     DN 32000 = 1.0 +/-   # 16 bit output

compress=zip
compress=none

output=fit depth

The +/- allows both positive and negative feature output.
	(normally, if an absorption band is expected, and a negative one
	is found, tricorder zeros the output.  The +/- stops that
	truncation.  This could be used, for example, in tracking
	residual 2.0um CO2 features.

The compress option allows compressing the output file after the program is
complete (so a lot of disk space is still required).

the output specifier says what files to output.  all is default.
others are fit, depth, and fd

================================================================
Also make thresholding options a separate line after output
     with an option specifier.
================================================================
Add continuum thresholding in place of the ct with each feature:

     rct low high  # right continuum threshold
     cct low high  # center continuum threshold
     lct low high  # left continuum threshold

the cct stands for continuum threshold at center and used to be
called ct.

Add band depth thresholding on a per feature basis:

     bd low high   # band depth
================================================================

Allow alternate library reference spectra, to be selected at time of library
setup:

alternatelib=2  # two alternate library reference spectra.
BKMN1X          # keyword for alternate 1
AVIRIS          # keyword for alternate 2

keyword applied to the specpr reference library file.  Note that you
must properly have the alias definitions set to refer to the correct
specpr file.  Note that you must also set the deleted points alias for
the alternate in use.

================================================================
Gregg has suggested that we create an output specpr file of the
convolved spectra.  That way, we can archive the spectral library
used to map a cube.  It also give us a convolved library for comparison
when we convolve on the fly.

Roger adds:
In addition, we could output a continuum removed feature library.

In both above cases, we could delete the points, so we can see just what
is fitted.  These outputs would be defined at the beginning of the
library setup.

liboutput filename  # convolved spectral library output file
                      (none means no output) 

featoutput filename # continuum-removed feature library output file
                      (none means no output)
