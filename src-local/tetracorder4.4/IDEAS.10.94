New ideas for tricorder to be implimented in tricorder 3.0:
Roger Clark

================================================================
case stuff

At the end of each commandlet, have an action command:

action: none         \# do nothing
action: case 1       \# do case 1
action: case 1 4 5   \# do case 1 then 4 then 5

cases are like groups, but are not done until a certain match
is found first.  

see examples in the group description below.
================================================================
Groups are all done.  Group 0 takes is applied to all groups.
(Meaning group 1 comparisons are group 0 + 1)

After the group or case designation, have additional optional qualifiers:

group 3 URATIO [splib04] 496 RRATIO [splib04] 496

where URATIO = unknown   spectrum / spectrum [splib04] 496
      RRATIO = reference spectrum / spectrum [splib04] 496


Typical uses:

group 0: vegetation, water, ice/snow
group 1: minerals/materials in 0.4 to ~1.2um
         (mostly electronic bands)
group 2: minerals/materials in 2-2.5 um region with support from 1-1.5um
         (mostly vibrational bands)
case 1: vegetation species (from veg, group 0)
case 2: vegeatation stress (from veg, group 0)
group 3: any level vegetation chlorophyll detection
case 3:  red-edge shift from group 3

A special flag "-0" can ba added after the group # to not include group
0 in the analysis.  (Note all entries in the group should be treated the
same, or bizzare results might be encountered.)  Example:

group 4 -0 URATIO [splib04] 496 RRATIO [splib04] 496

================================================================
The udata specifier specifies on what data to analyze:
          (udata is the unknown, e.g. spectra from the cube)

udata: reflectance     # operate on reflectance data
udata: emittance       # operate on emittance data
udata: radiance        # operate on radiance data
udata: raw             # operate on raw data

The observed data set will leter be specified what type it is in.
The udata specifier says what it should be converted to before this
analysis is done.

The idea here is that in the future, we only store one data type (e.g.
the AVIRIS radiance data) and compute what we need on the fly.  The
specification of how to convert is specified elsewhere (in the section
where the cube is assigned).

For example, if the input data were in radiance, and the analysis
should be done in reflectance, then convert the data to reflectance
first.  At Tricorder 3.0, this will be informational only.  A future
version will have conversions added.  For example, the radiance to
reflectance will do an ATRM correction followed by an offset and
multiplier ground calibration.

This feature allows us to do atmospheric analyses on radiance data and
surface reflectance analysis at the same time!  For example, one group
could be atmospheric analysis, the others surface reflectance.  In the
future when we have thermal data in the same cube, coregistered, yet
another group could be analyzing emittance.

Currently, reflectance and emittance are the same.  (With the Mars
Surveyor TES instrument, a calibration to emittance could be applied.)

The raw specifier means don't do anything to the data.
================================================================
the convolve specifier tells whether or not to convolve the
             input reference spectrum to the resolution and sampling
             of the flight instrument

With this feature, we can convolve the reference spectra on the fly and
we don't have to generate separate spectral libraries for each data set.
(Of course, when comparing spectra, we will need the convolved ones, so
maybe this really won't help.)

convolve: no     # don't convolve
convolve: gaussian wav= [splib04] 12 res= [splib04] 14

where the wav= specifies the specpr file and record for the
               reference spectrum input wavelengths
          res= specifies the specpr file and record for the
               reference spectrum input resolution
          gaussian specifies do a gaussian convolution

The tricorder setup will now ask for the resolution as well as
    the wavelengths of the data that are being analyzed.
================================================================
The algorithm specifier:
After the convolve designation, the method of analysis is specified:

algorithm: bandmp      # the band fitting routines
algorithm: canopychem  # canopy chemistry
algorithm: linunmix    # linear unmixing (e.g. John Adams)
algorithm: bandratio   # band ratioing

Generally, the bandmp would be used in all the groups, then the
other algorithms used in cases.

For example, when you find a lot of veg, do a case and determine
canopy chemistry.

This has the potential for very complex analysis.  For example, determine
there is veg in the pixel, apply a software defoliant, then redo the
analysis on the veg removed spectra.  (Need to be careful about infinite
loops here.)

At tricorder 3.0, only bandmp will be implimented; others will follow.
================================================================
predefine the paths for group1, group2, etc.

all group 0 identifications (done in conjunction with each group 1,
2, ...) are put in with the path with the group currently being
identified.  For example, if material A is group 0, and group 2
materials are being analyzed, if A is found, then the output is in
the directory of group 2 materials.

Implications: if group 0 material has further action, then must set
a flag so it is not done twice?
================================================================
history:
          add specpr file names for v, w, u, d, and y as comments in the
          history file.
================================================================
Cube assignment:  allow from command line so doesn't have to be
                  assigned in specpr
================================================================
Output file bits/pixel and scale

bits   DN # = #
 8     DN 255   = 0.5   #  8 bit output
16     DN 32000 = 1.0   # 16 bit output

Also make thresholding options a separate line after outputm
     with an option specifier.
================================================================
Add continuum thresholding in place of the ct with each feature:

     rct low high  # right continuum threshold
     cct low high  # center continuum threshold
     lct low high  # left continuum threshold

the cct stands for continuum threshold at center and used to be
called ct.

Add band depth thresholding on a per feature basis:

     bd low high   # band depth
