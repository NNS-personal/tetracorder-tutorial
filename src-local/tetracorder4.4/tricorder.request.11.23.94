if you look at the file "results" in /i1/tmp/resolution/work you will see that it contains

What I need is for the unknown mineral title (with s/n) and tricorder pick
to occur on the same line.  Would it be a hard modification for you to do?

This way I could do Tricorder on all the mineral spectra and append to the
results file.  Then I could do the greping for the tricorder identification
and s/n.


What I will do to the results file is:

1) grep for a given s/n

then grep this output for the mineral id

this will give me from one grepped line all the information I need.

2) I will do a word count on the output from the greps


What I need as output is:

Title of unknown             Title of Tricorder ID mineral


all on the same line.  can you do this please?
