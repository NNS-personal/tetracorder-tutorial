Installation of specpr and tetracorder packages on linux.

Be sure the latest versions of gfortran and ratfor are installed.

Be sure X11 is installed (e.g. X11/Xlib.h is needed)

Untar the tetracorder and specpr source code in the same directory,
we recommend /usr/local

cd to the specpr directory (specpr must be compiled before tetracorder):

     cd specpr

View and follow the directions in AAA.INSTALL.INSTRUCTIONS.linux_unix.txt

Next cd to the tetracorder directory and run make:

     cd /src/local/tetracorder4.4
     make
     make install
     cp /usr/local/bin/tetracorder4.4 /usr/local/bin/tetracorder

cd to the usr.local.bin_tetracorder_support directory and copy
all the scripts to /usr/local/bin

     cd  /src/local/usr.local.bin_tetracorder_support
     cp * /usr/local/bin

Confirm that the scripts are executable by all users who will
run tetracorder.

Install the davinci package from http://davinci.asu.edu

   Davinci is needed to run post tetracorder analysis scripts
   These tools analyze results and create the gif and jpeg
   image products of the results that enable rapid assessment
   of results.
