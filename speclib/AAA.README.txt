This directory contains the native spectral library and convolutions of the library.
The current spectral library is:

           splib06a

These directories should be put in a location of choice with
a symbolic link (on unix/linux) where /speclib points to these
directories.

Say you put the directories:
       library06
       library06.conv
into /data/usgs, then make a symbolic link:

       ln -s /data/usgs /speclib

Next confirm:

       ls -l /speclib
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 May 15 12:10 /speclib -> /data/usgs/speclib/
