The directory contains setup scripts for making a
tetracorder run.

Place the contents of this directory into your own
directory, then edit the file:

          tetsetup

and change the line:

    source=/info/tetracorder/tetracorder4.4.cmds

to point to the directory where you installed these files.

Next, cd to the directory where you want to do a mapping run
(e.g. cd /mymapping/ ), and type:

      tetsetup

and it will tell you the parameters you need.  They are:

1) a sub-directory name where the mapping is to be done.
   This must not presently exist.

2) A data set keyword and a list of recognized data sets
   is listed if no parameters are given on the command line

3) The cube naem including the lunix/unix path.  The total path length
   must be less than 70 characters.  Example:

       /cubes/cuprite95-beta-intel_rtgc

   If the cube is an envi file, specify the header file, e.g.

       /cubes/cuprite95-beta-intel_rtgc.hdr

   The cube MUST be in the byte order of the machine where tetracorder
   is running.  Tetracorder will not swap bytes.

   example setup command:

   /info/tetracorder/tetracorder4.4.cmds/tetsetup cuprite-mapping1 aviris_1995 /cubes/cuprite95-beta-intel_rtgc.hdr

Running Tetracorder:

   The install script created the cuprite-mapping1 directory
   in the above example, makes the necessary sub-directories
   needed by tetracorder, copies the tetracorder start up script
   and expert system commands, and post processing support
   programs to the mapping directory.

   It then tells you to cd to the directory and
   gives you the command to cut and paste to start the tetracorder
   run.

   If tetracorder encounters any problems, it will stop.  You will
   need to foreground the process, type e<carriage return>x<carriage return>
   and repeat until tetracorder exits.  The examine the 
   tetracorder.out and cmd.1.out files to diagnose any problems.
   Common problems are needing to tune continuum end-points for
   spectral library entries in the expert system to to limited
   spectral range by the imaging spectrometer (for example, because
   of some bad bands).  In that case you will need to make
   scientific decisions on how to modify the expert system.

======================
To add a new data set:

3 files must be edited:

1) Add do the tetsetup script (search for Hymap_2007a and copy
that style for the new data set).

2) Edit the DELETED.channels file and add the new daat set bad bands
   list.  The list is specpr deleted points style, a letter "c"
   a "#" and the keyword (e.g. Hymap_2007a) and any other comments
   you want.

3) Copy a restart file in the directory restart_files and name it with:
   r1-<data set keyword>   For example:

   cp restart_files/r1-s06hy07a restart_files/r1-mydata01

   The specpr file names are limited to 8 characters.
   s06hy07a = specptral library 06, hymap 2007 a wavelengths.

   Nest edit the new file (restart_files/r1-mydata01) and change
   the s06hy07a in 3 locations to your new name (e.g. mydata01)

Next you will need to create a convolved spectral library
(use your favorite tools or see our speclib package).
